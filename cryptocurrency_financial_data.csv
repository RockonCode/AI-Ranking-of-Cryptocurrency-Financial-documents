The CD20 is flat, trading at 2,174.

Ether {{ETH}} was changing hands just above $3,000 during the opening hours of the Asia trading day as the CoinDesk Indices Ethereum Trend Indicator flipped negative, signaling a bearish shift in momentum.

At the same time, bitcoin {{BTC}}, is trading slightly above $64,000 after challenging it for most of the Asia trading morning.


""Unexpected higher U.S. treasury yields, a stronger dollar, and geopolitical risks in the Middle East weighed down on crypto markets,"" Jun-young Heo, a Derivatives Trader at Singapore-based Presto, said in an interview on Telegram with CoinDesk.

Yeo said that risk-off sentiment was also reflected in the derivatives market, with funding rates in some exchanges turning negative and three-month basis yields ""plunging"" to 10%.

""Short-term put options are more expensive than call options for both BTC and ETH,"" Heo continued.

Liquidations in the last 12 hours came in almost evenly split between bullish and bearish futures bets, with $31.1 million in long positions getting liquidated and $36.49 million in shorts getting rekt.

""It seems investors have been unable to break all-time highs but remain unwilling to completely turn bearish either,"" Justin d'Anethan, head of business development at Keyrock, a crypto market maker in Hong Kong, said in a note to CoinDesk.

The CoinDesk 20, an index measuring the performance of the world's largest digital assets, is effectively flat trading at 2,174.

""It is a difficult environment to navigate with a series of positive crypto-centric catalysts,"" he continued. On the other hand, the macro side of things seems to be dominating all risk assets, with more hawkish rate expectations in light of surprisingly higher inflation and, of course, the increase in tension in the Middle East.""

d'Anethan also noted that sideways price action and settling into a range could, in crypto, set the stage for more explosive moves, with leveraged traders taking a view and then suffering from violent liquidation events when the scene clears up, bringing a decisive move in markets.

""It might need some time or other catalyst rather than known events to turn this sentiment back to bullish,"" added Heo.

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-altcoins-were-sliding-again-225716747.html,Why Altcoins Were Sliding Again Today,"This isn't shaping up to be a banner week for crypto, as some of the top altcoins in the space lost value Tuesday. A pronouncement from a top Federal Reserve issue dampened sentiment, which was already sinking following the recent cryptocurrency rally.

That being said, the Tuesday losses were, by and large, not massive. Bellwether meme coin Dogecoin (CRYPTO: DOGE) was down by more than 3% in late afternoon trading, while the theoretically more serious utility coins Chainlink (CRYPTO: LINK) and Bitcoin Cash (CRYPTO: BCH) shed a respective 2% and 4%. Aptos (CRYPTO: APT) was also in negative territory, but barely, as it was off 0.1%.

The Fed talks, and the crypto world listens
The bad guys, if you will, in this story are Fed Chair Jerome Powell and Vice Chair Philip Jefferson. On Wednesday, both strongly indicated that the likeliness of the central bank cutting its key interest rate was dropping.


In remarks at a Washington, D.C., event, Powell said, ""The recent data have clearly not given us greater confidence and instead indicate that it's likely to take longer than expected to achieve that confidence.""

Separately, Jefferson opined that the Fed should keep its powder dry should inflation remain persistent. In a separate event, he said, ""The job of sustainably restoring 2% inflation is not yet done.""

That's the general mood on interest rates these days from the Fed and other government officials following the latest data on inflation, which, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, rose by 3.5% in March. Unhappily for rate hawks, that was above the typical economist forecast and represented a notable uptick from the February number.

That wouldn't necessarily be discouraging in and of itself, but only a few months ago, hopes were much higher. At that point, following developments with inflation that were actually positive, Fed officials stated that they aimed to make not one, not two, but as many as three rate cuts over the course of this year.

Injurious inflation
The Fed's key interest rates are not the be-all and end-all for crypto investors but are nevertheless crucial. When rates climb, so too do the safest securities on the market (considered to be government bonds).

When safety plays become more attractive, the market as a whole tends to sell out of the riskier assets. In years past, this was tech stocks; these days, cryptos fit the bill. And the less utility a particular cryptocurrency has, the more downside potential opens up below it. (Attention, Dogecoin and other meme coin investors!)

Many crypto bulls will continue to monitor developments with inflation. The battle against it, after all, might be longer and more difficult than many expected.",Bitcoin
https://finance.yahoo.com/news/spot-bitcoin-etf-hype-dies-193232666.html,"Spot Bitcoin ETF Hype Dies Down, Normalcy Sets In","Spot bitcoin ETF flows have slowed after weeks of heavy buying.

Only IBIT, BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust, continues its streak of consecutive daily positive flows.

This is a normal development within the ETF space, an expert said.

The initial euphoria for the spot bitcoin ETFs has seemingly dampened and reality is slowly kicking in with inflows recently unable to keep up with the still speedy pace of exits from Grayscale's Bitcoin Trust (GBTC).


The result is that in the week ended April 12, the spot ETFs as a whole saw a net outflow of 1,766 bitcoins.

On last Friday and again on Monday, Fidelity’s Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) had inflows of $0, breaking its streak of daily additions that started at launch on January 11. That leaves BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) as the only spot bitcoin ETF left that's experienced an unbroken string of inflows since the vehicles began trading.

For most of the remaining funds, including the Invesco Galaxy Bitcoin ETF (BTCO), the VanEck Bitcoin Trust (HODL) and the Valkyrie Bitcoin Fund (BRRR), among others, zero inflows and even the occasional outflow has become the norm.

This is not out of the ordinary, said James Seyffart, ETF analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence in a post on X. He points out that around 83% of all ETFs on the U.S. market saw zero inflows on Monday, for example.

Seyffart explained that the creation and redemption of shares of an ETF only takes place when a large enough mismatch in supply and demand exists and the cost to do so is lower than hedging. In the case of the bitcoin ETFs, these creation units range anywhere from 5,000 to 50,000 shares. “Minor mismatches will see the market makers handle trading of shares just like they would a stock,” Seyffart wrote.

The recent slowdown doesn’t however mean that traders need to get used to lower flows. While the initial sentiment for the ETFs in the first few weeks of existence certainly resulted in volume higher than any other ETFs have seen before, traders could see more significant positive flows in the future.

“There is surely potential for a resurgence in inflows,” said Samir Kerbage, chief investment officer at Hashdex, which converted its bitcoin futures fund into a spot bitcoin ETF in March.

“Many banks, endowments, and pension funds worldwide are only now beginning their due diligence processes before considering strategic allocations to BTC through newly launched ETFs,"" Kerbage continued. ""As these large financial institutions make decisions over the coming months, it is likely that inflows will increase once again, potentially reaching new milestones for what has been one of the most successful ETF launches in US history.”

Turning to Grayscale's Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), which continues to see outflows of 1,000 or more bitcoins on a daily basis, Seyffart isn't anticipating a reversal. “I do not really expect inflows into GBTC as it’s currently constructed,” he told CoinDesk. “With GBTC at a 1.5% expense ratio, I would be surprised if GBTC saw any net inflow days and shocked if it saw sustained inflows over any time period.”",Bitcoin

U.S. major averages display mixed performances as of midday trading Tuesday. The S&P 500 holds steady at 5,200 points, while blue-chip stocks outperform the broader market, and small caps experience some declines.


In its April World Economic Outlook, the International Monetary Fund raised growth projections for the U.S. economy, while eyeing the possibility of Federal Reserve rate cuts this year as inflation declines. Yet, an escalation in the Middle East could complicate the picture, pushing oil and inflation higher and forcing central banks to tighten again.

Treasury yields continue to kick higher, with the yield on the 10-year Treasury bond reaching 4.65%. Bond-related ETFs declined further, with the iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF (NASDAQ:TLT) down 0.5%.

Despite the uptick in yields and a stronger dollar, gold continues to showcase an impressive strength, with the yellow metal up 0.3% to $2,390 per ounce, on track for a record-high close.

Oil prices were slightly softer, down 0.4%. Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) is down 2.5% to $61,900, marking a 15% drop since last week’s high.

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bitcoiners-saying-upcoming-bitcoin-halving-175749707.html,What Bitcoiners Are Saying About the Upcoming Bitcoin Halving,"On April 19, or whenever a bitcoin miner mines block number 840,000, the amount of bitcoin {{BTC}} entering into circulation will halve from about 900 a day to 450. This event, colloquially known as the halving (sometimes halvening), looms large in the Bitcoin mindshare, one of those things that makes Bitcoin Bitcoin. Perhaps because it only comes around on Leap Years (so far), bitcoiners tend to look forward to the halving more than most crypto holidays like Bitcoin Pizza Day or the anniversary of Satoshi Nakamoto publishing the white paper. But it won't be around forever.

This roundup is part of CoinDesk’s “Future of Bitcoin” package.

Once all 21 million bitcoins are mined, the halving will have served its purpose and cease (likely in 2140). Why did Nakamoto make it this way? No one knows. Just like there's no real insight into why he chose a 21 million cap or Jan. 9 as launch day. There are many, many guesstimates that try to make sense of these seemingly arbitrary elements of Bitcoin's design. Because if there's one thing certain about Bitcoin, it's that it tends to split opinions.

And so, with an event as anticipated as the halving there are certainly things to argue over. Is it ""priced in"" (meaning will the reduction in supply of bitcoins entering the market cause a rally)? Will the reduced revenues drive bitcoin miners bankrupt? Will this time be any different?

CoinDesk turned to the crypto community to get their say:

Priced in?
Haseeb Qureshi, managing partner at Dragonfly Capital:

I am a longtime halving nihilist. The halving is *what it means* for bitcoin to be deflationary. It's been priced in since the first time someone bought bitcoin because it has a fixed supply. The timing of the halving has been baked in since Bitcoin was first launched six years ago.

People drawing charts and rainbows and all this nonsense over an event that has deterministically happened four times (on an asset that already goes up almost every single year) is pseudoscientific nonsense. But whatever, it's a good story.

Austin Campbell, assistant professor at Columbia Business School:

As bitcoin gains more of a foothold in traditional finance, events that were drivers of past cycles like the halving will cease to have as much of an impact, if any. Portfolio allocators think in multi-year and multi-decade terms, and the impact of events like the halving will be muted as this market segment grows, just like any market growing from new to mainstream sees volatility due to small idiosyncratic events decrease as liquidity and scale increase.

Azeem Khan, co-founder of Morph:

My personal opinion is the halving is likely priced in. We’ve seen institutional capital inflows for months now since the bitcoin spot ETF was approved. And even before that we were seeing a lot of liquidity enter the market without seeing traditional signs that retail was buying with things like Coinbase being the number one app in the App Store. To me, that indicated it was already institutional money coming in. They’re not dumb and have likely been buying ahead of this. Larry Fink didn’t get to where he is by accident.

My personal philosophy in this space has tended to be that when everyone agrees something is going to happen, it generally doesn’t. Similar to when we had Elon being a clown on SNL pumping $DOGE in 2021 and everyone had agreed it was going to $1, it dumped.

The investing approach I abide by has always been to dollar cost average. Pick an amount you’re willing to lose, set an auto buy for that amount of whichever assets you’ve done your research on, continue to buy over the long term every X period, and never look at the price. If you’re investing with a long term approach in mind, this will help you beat out 99% of the noise you see from gambling addicts, some of which turned out to be the lottery winners of Crypto Twitter when zooming out through the years.

Not priced in
Edan Yago, founder of Sovryn:

Definitely not priced in. Not even close. This is the most important halving since the first. This halving will bring new assets to Bitcoin in the form of Runes and the coming cycle will see Bitcoin Rollups add scalability and programmability to Bitcoin. Bitcoin block space will go from cheap to the scarcest computing resource in the world.

Ogle, founder of Glue:

I think this halving is distinct from prior ones because of the significant increase in capital coming into the market because of the ETF approvals. So you have a reduction of supply because of the halving itself, combined with increased demand from the ETFs — basic economic principles say this should result in a higher price. My guess is the halving has partially been priced in, but I don't think people quite realize the magnitude of buy pressure that is coming in via the ETFs — and that buy pressure is in my view going to significantly impact the price of BTC upward.",Bitcoin
https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-much-bitcoin-become-millionaire-173014879.html,"Here's How Much Bitcoin You Need To Become a Millionaire, According To Michael Saylor","MicroStrategy Inc. (NASDAQ:MSTR) Chairman Michael Saylor says you can never have too much Bitcoin.

While this isn't surprising coming from one of the world's largest Bitcoin investors, his comments could influence markets and provide more insights into why he believes Bitcoin (BTC) is a great investment.

Don't Miss:

If you invested $100 in DOGE when Elon Musk first tweeted about it in 2019, here’s how much you’d have today.

Bitcoin To $100,000? Here’s what gold bug Peter Schiff said could happen on Anthony Pompliano’s podcast.

Saylor's company has acquired over 214,000 BTC in the past several years, holding more than  1% of the entire supply. MicroStrategy bought the tokens for an average price of around $35,000 and used a $700 million convertible bond offering to purchase more Bitcoin in March. MicroStrategy has since rebranded into the ""world's first Bitcoin development company.""

With this huge investment, Saylor sees the price of Bitcoin continuing to increase. Saylor details several reasons he thinks Bitcoin is poised to do well in the coming months and years.

First, he sees the upcoming Bitcoin halving, expected to occur this week, as a major catalyst moving forward.

""You’re going to see $12 billion of natural selling per year converted into $6 billion of natural selling per year,"" Saylor said.

The halving will decrease the amount of new tokens added to the supply of each block, which would theoretically decrease selling pressures and allow the price to go up. The previous Bitcoin halvings have also served as price catalysts in the short term.

Trending: Bitcoin has jumped another 45% already this year – how much would you need to get started today? 

Saylor also pointed out that the spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) would provide more buying pressures on the market. These comments were made before the approval of the ETFs in January but have been largely correct. The spot Bitcoin ETFs have been the most successful in history, bringing in huge amounts of volume and propelling the price of Bitcoin higher.

Another point that is not discussed as often is the new accounting standard that changes the way corporations can account for Bitcoin on their balance sheets.

""This is going to open the door for corporations to adopt Bitcoin as a treasury asset and create shareholder value with their balance sheets,"" Saylor said.

The standard, introduced by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) in late 2023, allows companies to include changes in the size of their crypto position in net income.

With these points in mind, Saylor sees a bright future for Bitcoin. Saylor said he believes ""the industry moves to the next level and we 10x from here.""

At the time he made those comments, the price of Bitcoin was around $35,000. So, 10 times from those levels would mean that Bitcoin could go as high as $350,000, Saylor said. If this is the case, you would need to own 2.86 BTC to become a millionaire. It would cost around $190,000 today.",Bitcoin

""It still hasn't recovered from that sharp pullback,"" Teddy Fusaro, president of Bitwise, told Fortune.

Over the weekend, the price of Bitcoin fell over 10%, from around $70,000 to $62,000, where it has since remained, while some altcoins sank over 15%. Similar to U.S. equities across the board, when reports of the attack first broke, short-term traders who view Bitcoin as a riskier asset—some of whom were leveraged 50x or more and could no longer cover their positions—were forced to liquidate. Crypto markets rebounded slightly on news that Israel and its allies shot down nearly every Iranian missile and drone but have since retreated.

""It was the only asset in financial markets that was tradable at that time, which is one of Bitcoin's unique strengths,"" Fusaro added, ""but also makes it susceptible to swings in price over the weekend when it is the only venue for transferring risk during that time.""",Bitcoin
https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bitcoin-miners-must-optimize-survive-155145724.html,Bitcoin Miners Must Optimize to Survive,"On or around April 19, the fourth Bitcoin halving will take place, cutting in half the rewards miners receive for solving a block on the Bitcoin blockchain. The halving event is programmed into Bitcoin's protocol every 210,000 blocks and occurs roughly every four years. It is designed to limit the digital asset’s total supply and establish a fundamental scarcity. Therefore, efficiency is critical for bitcoin {{BTC}} mining companies to remain competitive as the 2024 halving approaches and even as the following halving in 2028 is considered.

To prepare, bitcoin miners must examine three key areas of their business: power, operations and software.

This feature is part of CoinDesk’s “Future of Bitcoin” package published to coincide with the fourth Bitcoin “halving” in April 2024.

Adam Sullivan is CEO of Core Scientific, a bitcoin mining firm.

Power is bitcoin miners' single largest cost item and it bounds the ability to bring hashrate online. By nature of the highly competitive market, miners only target low-cost and stranded power. Optimizing the efficiency of mining operations is extremely important and is driven mainly by the energy efficiency of the Bitcoin mining machines in a company’s fleet. To compensate for the revenue cut, miners are improving average fleet energy efficiency by replacing older, less efficient miners with the latest and most efficient miners. Overall, more efficient fleets will improve margin profiles and competitive positioning within the industry.",Bitcoin

He has served as head of European hedge fund sales for equities at Goldman Sachs and a portfolio manager at a hedge fund. More recently, he started his own crypto hedge fund, investment research firm and financial knowledge platform. His opinion on crypto is valued around the world, and he is constantly sending out market insights to his 1 million followers on X.

Pal considered many factors to arrive at his prediction that Bitcoin will go as high as $1 million by 2025.

Don't Miss:

About 22% of the adult population in the U.S. own a share of Bitcoin, how much would $10 get you today?

If you invested $100 in DOGE when Elon Musk first tweeted about it in 2019, here’s how much you’d have today.

He notes that Bitcoin has seen exponential growth, highlighting the trend on a logarithmic chart. The trend is similar to the 2016-2017 bull market, with large amounts of capital coming in and the halving supporting the increased price.

Pal added that the Bitcoin halving, expected to occur this week, could propel prices. In 2016 and 2020, the halving served as the dividing line between small gains/consolidation and huge amounts of growth. In particular, the price of Bitcoin went from around $800 just before the halving to a high of over $20,000 in 2016; the price went from around $10,000 before the 2020 halving to a high of nearly $70,000. The halving could have a huge impact on the price if the Bitcoin market cycle continues to drive the market.

If you are interested in the Bitcoin market cycle, check out an in-depth analysis of the trend and whether it is real.

Another point that Pal emphasized was the collapse of several large banks last year. The banks, such as Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) and First Republic Bank, failed because of mismanagement. Pal said the collapsed banks strengthen the case for institutional adoption of Bitcoin because the crypto is decentralized and secured by blockchain technology.

Lastly, Pal sees the spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) as a huge driver for growth going forward. The ETFs allowed many new investors to buy Bitcoin via the funds, which have been the most successful in ETF history. The new buyers have helped propel the price of Bitcoin higher, reaching all-time highs (ATHs) in March.

""There is an enormous wall of money coming into (Bitcoin),"" Pal said in October 2020. ""It's an enormous wall of money, just the pipes aren't there to allow people to do it yet, and that's coming, but it's on everyone's radar screen, and there are a lot of smart people working on it.""

The Bitcoin ETFs have since provided the means for some of these institutions to invest in BTC.

Pal believes that Bitcoin could go as high as $1 million by 2025. As of now, $1,000 is worth around 0.0155 BTC. If BTC were to go to $1 million, 0.0155 Bitcoin would be worth $15,500. This would mark a return of 1,450%.",Bitcoin
https://finance.yahoo.com/news/og-bitcoin-l2-stacks-getting-133403329.html,OG Bitcoin L2 Stacks Is Getting a Major Overhaul,"Amid a rekindling of Bitcoin development fervor, layer-2 network Stacks is looking to reinvent itself. As early as April 16, the major player in the Bitcoin L2 sector will kick off the release of its so-called Nakamoto upgrade, in the works for years – designed to dramatically increase the project's speed.

This article is part of CoinDesk’s “Future of Bitcoin” package published to coincide with the fourth Bitcoin “halving” in April 2024.

It’s a defining moment for the blockchain project that has been in development for nearly half a decade, but officially launched its mainnet in 2021. In short: Stacks is an attempt to scale Bitcoin by creating a dedicated chain for cheaper and faster transactions and Ethereum-like smart contract programmability, but maintains Bitcoin’s strong finality and security powered by miners.

“In a way, [Nakamoto is] sort of fulfilling the original intent of Stacks,” Stacks creator Muneeb Ali said in an interview with CoinDesk, referring to a message Stacks developers encoded into the network’s Genesis block that cited an idea Satoshi Nakamoto had about a universe of blockchain’s that “share” computational power with Bitcoin. “Now that will be possible.”

The upgrade comes at a time of exploding interest in Bitcoin L2s, largely driven by the “Ordinals revolution” that began last year that made it possible to launch a number of never-before-seen tokens – from meme coins to NFT-like “inscriptions” – on a blockchain once thought to be in development hell.",
https://finance.yahoo.com/news/exploding-gold-sales-pawnshops-offers-131545670.html,Exploding Gold Sales at Pawnshops Offers Lesson for Bitcoin Bulls,"There are plenty of reasons to be bullish on gold, but the evergreen bear case on the precious metal is that it's never really consumed. Every ounce of gold that's been mined since the beginning of time is still here.

To wit is a Bloomberg story over the weekend reporting on a flood of customers rushing into a Brooklyn pawnshop with their valuables to cash in on gold's recent run to a record price above $2,400 per ounce. ""People are using gold as an ATM they never had,"" owner Gene Furman, who is seeing three times the normal traffic of sellers since the metal's rally began in earnest two months ago, told Bloomberg.

Buyers appear to have gone on strike at these prices as well, with the U.S. Mint posting March American Eagle gold coin sales that were roughly 10% of the level hit a year prior.

Whither bitcoin?
There are clear differences between gold and bitcoin {{BTC}}, but they share many similar properties. Among them is that bitcoin, too, is never truly consumed and all that's ever been mined is still with us (though some may be unavailable due to lost private keys).

Mostly thanks to boosted demand from the spot ETFs, bitcoin by mid-March had risen nearly 70% for 2024 to a new record above $73,000. The rally has stalled since, with the price now more than 15% below that all-time high. The reasons for the pullback are up for debate, but for the last month, sellers have overwhelmed a modestly slowed but still quick pace of buying by the ETFs.

While bulls like to point to just 900 bitcoin being mined per day (and with the bitcoin halving this week, that will be trimmed to 450 per day) versus ETF demand often numbering in the thousands per day, the math doesn't necessarily lead to ""number go up."" The circulating supply of bitcoin is nearly 20 million and at a high enough price, there have been plenty of willing sellers just as happy to cash in as those rushing to Gene Furman's pawnshop.

Just yesterday, in fact, an early crypto enthusiast moved 50 bitcoin mined in 2010 worth $3 million at current prices to crypto exchange Coinbase, likely with intent to sell. That follows December's move from an address that had been dormant for 13 years of more than 1,000 bitcoin worth $40 million to a trading desk.

The last word on gold and possibly bitcoin goes to Tobina Kahn, president of House of Kahn Estate Jewelers. ""It's very busy and we are getting more calls than ever before about clients wanting to bring in their jewels,"" she told Bloomberg. ""I'm telling the clients to bring them in now, as we are at unprecedented levels.""",Bitcoin

OKX, the fourth-largest crypto exchange, said its new layer-2 blockchain, X Layer, has gone live on its public mainnet, joining other major crypto companies in starting its own distributed network. X Layer, previously known as X1, makes use of Polygon's Chain Development Kit (CDK), a customizable toolkit that lets developers build their own chains by making use of zero-knowledge technology. The firm joins other major cryptocurrency exchanges that have pursued their own layer-2 networks over the past year. In August, Coinbase launched its “Base” blockchain, which is built with Optimism’s OP Stack. Kraken is reportedly also interested in creating its own layer-2 blockchain.

Bitcoin miners may have underperformed the cryptocurrency this year, but their CEOs remain upbeat as the reward halving approaches, broker Bernstein said in a research report on Monday.

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/dogecoin-millionaire-maker-121500422.html,Is Dogecoin a Millionaire Maker?,"As of this writing, Dogecoin trades at about $0.16. The cryptocurrency lost its luster as rising rates drove investors toward more conservative investments. Bigger cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin -- which actually rose more than 10% as Dogecoin shed more than 80% of its value -- also attracted more retail and institutional investors.

Is it time for investors to finally give up on Dogecoin? Or could it still bounce back and generate millionaire-making gains for daring investors?

Why did Dogecoin's price skyrocket in 2021?
Dogecoin was created from the open-source code for Litecoin, an altcoin that was forked from Bitcoin's blockchain in 2011. Many investors initially dismissed Dogecoin as a joke, but its developers subsequently upgraded the token with higher access speeds and cheaper transactions.

Dogecoin's developers achieved those improvements through its own hashing algorithm Scrypt, which was less power-intensive than Bitcoin's own mining algorithm. As a result, Dogecoin started to gain more attention from online supporters, who called themselves the ""Doge Army.""

Its growing popularity caught the attention of celebrities like Elon Musk, Mark Cuban, and Snoop Dogg, who all promoted the token to their social media followers in 2021. At the same time, social media buzz and stimulus checks drove many retail investors toward growth stocks, meme stocks, cryptocurrencies, and other speculative investments. Those tailwinds propelled Dogecoin's stock to its all-time high.

Why did Dogecoin's price tumble during the next three years?
But during the next three years, Dogecoin's price tumbled as rising interest rates heralded the beginning of a new ""crypto winter."" Dogecoin was also left out in the cold earlier this year when the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved the first batch of Bitcoin spot price exchange-traded funds (ETFs) while dismissing similar ETFs for other cryptocurrencies.

To make matters worse, the failures of several high-profile cryptocurrency exchanges and tokens cast dark clouds over Dogecoin and other altcoins. The New York State Department of Financial Services (DFS) also recently excluded Dogecoin from its ""green list"" of eight regulated cryptocurrencies: Bitcoin, Ethereum, and six stablecoins from PayPal and Gemini. That exclusion implies that Dogecoin is a much riskier asset.

Dogecoin is now accepted as a payment method at a handful of businesses, but its volatile price doesn't make it an appealing option for making most payments. The Dogechain blockchain network, which was built by Dogecoin holders, enables the development of decentralized apps, games, and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) -- but it isn't as widely used as the Ethereum Network for developing decentralized applications.

Without those foundations, it's hard to properly value Dogecoin. That's why Bitcoin and Ethereum both outperformed Dogecoin after it peaked in 2021.",Bitcoin

Eight of the top 10 best performing ETFs last week were digital currency funds, largely led by Ethereum futures funds. The best performing fund was the nearly $70 million ProShares Ether Strategy ETF (EETH), which gained 12% last week. The Ark21Shares Active Ethereum Futures Strategy ETF (ARKZ), was also up 12%, along with the Bitwise Ethereum Strategy ETF (AETH). ARK's combined bitcoin and ethereum futures fund, the ARK 21Shares Active Bitcoin Ethereum Strategy ETF (ARKY) was up 11%, according to etf.com data.

Inflows last week were led by the $2.79 billion that went into the Vanguard 500 Index Fund (VOO) while outflows were topped by the $2.69 billion that flowed from the iShares Core S&P 500 ETF (IVV)

The two largest cryptocurrencies have been down over the past week, according to database CoinMarketCap.com. Ethereum is down 17% and Bitcoin fell 12% over the past week, according to the site.

While multiple issuers have filed for a novel spot ethereum exchange traded fund, which would directly hold ethereum as opposed to ether futures contracts, the price move seems unrelated to the SEC approval process, according to analysts. The SEC's next deadline is in May, but analysts are pessimistic about the vehicles' approval by the May deadline.

Also, bitcoin halving is expected this week.

The price of bitcoin has risen over 50% this year so far, partially on the approval of 10 spot bitcoin ETFs in mid-January. Since then, assets in those ETFs have reached about $60 billion.

Two carbon allowance ETFs, the iPath Series B Carbon ETN and the KraneShares European Carbon Allowance Strategy ETF, also rose roughly 10% last week.",
https://finance.yahoo.com/news/1-top-cryptocurrency-buy-soars-113000751.html,"1 Top Cryptocurrency to Buy Before It Soars 5,000%, According to Cathie Wood","Ethereum is the largest cryptocurrency on the open-source Ethereum Network, which differs from Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) in two key ways. First, miners can only mine for Bitcoin tokens on the Bitcoin blockchain, but developers can create their own tokens, decentralized apps (dApps), and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on the Ethereum Network. That flexibility makes Ethereum a core pillar of the Web3 movement, which aims to disrupt centralized app platforms like Apple's App Store and Alphabet's Google Play with decentralized applications and payment methods.

Second, Ethereum requires much less power to mine than Bitcoin. The Ethereum Network previously used the same energy-intensive proof of work (PoW) mining method as Bitcoin, but it in September 2022, it transitioned to the more energy-efficient proof of stake (PoS) method. That transition, dubbed The Merge, reduced the network's total mining energy consumption by 99.95%. Ethereum bulls believe that upgrade will make it easier to expand the Ethereum Network and support more Web3 projects.

What are Ethereum's main catalysts?
Ethereum is now the world's second-largest cryptocurrency after Bitcoin. It's also one of eight cryptocurrencies -- which include Bitcoin and six stablecoins from PayPal (NASDAQ: PYPL) and Gemini (CRYPTO: GUSD) -- on the New York State Department of Financial Services' ""green list"" of pre-approved cryptocurrencies. That relative stability suggests the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) might eventually approve spot Ethereum ETFs.

However, the SEC recently reiterated its view that Bitcoin was the only cryptocurrency that could be classified as a commodity instead of a security since it still uses the PoW method, which is comparable to physically mining precious metals. The SEC said the PoS method, while more environmentally friendly, makes the cryptos that use it more similar to derivatives contracts -- so Ethereum is more similar to a security than it is to a commodity.

The SEC also recently requested more information from the Ethereum Foundation, and it remains committed to reclassifying Ethereum and other Ethereum tokens as securities. That position implies the SEC probably won't approve any spot ETFs for Ethereum -- since commodities are more commonly valued by their spot prices -- in the foreseeable future.

But despite that, Ethereum's periodic burning of its tokens could stabilize its price in the near term. The upcoming upgrades for the Ethereum Network could also make it even easier to facilitate financial transactions and develop more decentralized tokens and apps. More companies could also begin accepting ether, the coin that powers the Ethereum blockchain, as a payment option, and institutional investors could accumulate more of the crypto -- even if it's not as easily accessible as Bitcoin through spot ETFs.",Bitcoin

The correlation between bitcoin and traditional market assets remains high, but some investors see the cryptocurrency as a viable hedge and investment option, with expectations its price could reach $120,000 in the coming months.

International politics and the search for an investment hedge could fuel a bitcoin {{BTC}} surge in the coming months, even after confidence in the largest cryptocurrency was dented by a 10% weekly drop, some traders say.

Bitcoin has long been considered a possible hedge against geopolitical events and was originally created in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis. Some traders say the hedging narrative remains viable despite BTC being highly correlated with traditional market assets for several years.

“Bitcoin remains a viable doomsday asset in 2024, as its correlation to Gold recently increased, and investors continue to diversify away from traditional financial assets,” Edouard Hindi, the chief investment officer at Tyr Capital, said in an email to CoinDesk.

“The ETF is currently spearheading this Doomsday rally and we should expect $120,000 to be hit in the coming months as global geopolitics continues to deteriorate and the middle classes continue to find ways to protect their wealth,” Hindi said.

Crypto markets were shattered over the weekend as tensions between Iran and Israel increased alongside profit-taking ahead of the bitcoin reward halving, a technical event expected on April 20 that will cut network rewards by 50%.

Major tokens lost as much as 18% on the weekend compared to last week’s peak prices before reversing some of the losses on Monday. The slide resumed in Asian morning hours on Tuesday as Israel considered its response to Iran's firing of more than 300 drones and missiles at its territory.

Elsewhere, inflows to bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETF) have slowed in the past week. Data shows only one product, BlackRock’s IBIT, saw inflows on Monday, while 10 other ETFs all saw outflows.

Some market observers say bitcoin’s short-term price action will set the course for the broader crypto market in the coming weeks.

“The sell-off in US stock markets affected global risk appetite late on Monday, reversing initial positivity. The market is hovering near the lows of March,” Alex Kuptsikevich, an FxPro senior market analyst, wrote in a daily note. “This is a key moment in choosing the market’s direction for the coming weeks. A bounce out of this area will allow for the expectation of an early recovery to the recent highs. A dip below would likely trigger a broader liquidation of positions.”",Bitcoin

The Stepn x Adidas Genesis Sneakers collection includes 1,000 digital items inspired by Adidas running designs. The NFT collection will be the first of multiple co-branded activities during a one-year partnership between the two companies which will include other NFT drops and physical, wearable items.

The shoe collection will drop via Stepn’s sister marketplace, Mooar, starting Wednesday via a two-phase raffle. The NFT collection is based on Solana and will be priced in Stepn’s currency of GMT tokens.

Dive Insight:
With its Stepn collaboration, Adidas is diving deeper into NFTs.

In early 2022, Adidas teamed up with Prada to launch an NFT project to promote the Adidas for Prada Re-Nylon collection. Later that year, the athletics brand created a new product category for virtual gear. The company at that time debuted its first NFT digital wearables collection, a 16-piece line featuring limited-edition products from Bored Ape Yacht Club, Gmoney and Punks Comics.

Stepn, launched in 2021 with a goal to incentivize exercise through rewards, said it has amassed 5 million registered users. Its collaboration with Adidas is part of its efforts to grow the “move-to-earn” market, per the press release.

“This collaboration between Stepn and Adidas underscores how powerful it is when you can move and earn in both the virtual and real world simultaneously,” Shiti Manghani, CEO of Stepn by FSL, said in a statement. “That such a physical and digital — or ‘phygital’ — partnership between the most widely used lifestyle app and a global brand like Adidas is now a reality indicates the direction lifestyle rewards are going.”

But as Adidas invests more into NFTs, other retailers have exited the market. Earlier this year, GameStop announced plans to exit its NFT marketplace, citing “the continuing regulatory uncertainty of the crypto space.”

Meanwhile, NFT trading has fallen sharply recently. NFT minting, meaning newly created NFTs, on the Solana blockchain has dropped to roughly 15,000 as of April 15, down from a peak of roughly 350,000 in December 2023, according to The Block. Overall, the NFT market has plunged from its August 2021 peak of $3.24 billion in trading volume to $75.8 million as of the week of April 14, per The Block’s analysis of Cryptoslam data.",Bitcoin

Crypto.com cut a fifth of its staff in early 2023 to control costs following a market rout that felled dozens of digital-asset outfits. The firm began hiring again after tokens including Bitcoin rallied. Rivals such as Coinbase Global Inc., Kraken, Binance and Gemini have also been adding staff.

Marszalek said in a Bloomberg News interview Tuesday that he hopes to triple registered users from more than 80 million currently. Hiring to support that growth will take place “slowly, thoughtfully, and strategically,” he said. “We’ve learned that we didn’t actually move faster just by increasing headcount.”

In a separate interview to Bloomberg TV, Marszalek said that Bitcoin selling may become evident as the date of the so-called halving nears but the event is set to bolster the price of the largest digital asset longer term.

The halving reduces new supply of Bitcoin and is expected around April 20. Historically, it’s proved a tailwind for prices, though there are doubts about whether a repeat is likely given Bitcoin already hit a record high in mid-March.

‘Sell-the-News’

“As we approach this date there may be some selling coming up” due to buy-the-rumor, sell-the-news trading, Marszalek said on television. Over a longer period, the halving will make a “substantial difference” and is a “positive development for the market,” he said.

Bitcoin was little changed at $63,260 as of 11 a.m. Tuesday in London. Inflows into three-month-old spot-Bitcoin exchange-traded funds in the US helped the token reach an all-time peak of $73,798 last month.

“I expect pretty decent action within the six months following the Bitcoin halving,” Marszalek said.

The halving will cut the amount of Bitcoin that so-called miners can earn each day for validating transactions to 450 from 900. Miners compete for the reward by solving mathematical puzzles using superfast computers.

Trading volume on Crypto.com over the past 24 hours topped $1.5 billion, CoinGecko figures show. Approximately half its users are in the US, about a third in Europe and the UK, and 10% in Asia, Marszalek added. The US accounts for 50% of the firm’s revenue.

The company will begin offering services for South Korean retail customers later this month, an expansion Marszalek described as a long-term strategy.

The broker held its 2024 Digital Assets Symposium last Thursday and hosted leaders from 29 crypto-related companies.

“It is becoming clear now that there is a material multiplier effect also underway from the ETFs in driving additional demand for the underlying BTC spot itself,” analysts led by Joseph Vafi wrote.

The broker noted comments from Swan Bitcoin, a bitcoin-only investment advisor, which said it is “seeing a multiple-fold increase in demand for an underlying spot as the ETFs drive the BTC demand curve to the right, while the BTC supply curve can’t respond in kind.”

Canaccord said that many investors, both retail and institutional, ""Find the underlying BTC spot more attractive than ETFs given potentially more ways to hedge and generate yield on HODLs over time as the asset class matures.”

In the coming months, spot bitcoin ETFs will be added to multiple registered investment advisor (RIA) platforms and large broker/dealer wirehouses, and with this added distribution, “investment advisors that could more or less ignore bitcoin will now be forced to at least have an opinion” on the cryptocurrency, the report said.

Some institutions, in particular sovereign wealth funds, are likely already invested in bitcoin, and Canaccord expects to see announcements from these types of investors in the next few months.

Despite the hype and celebrity endorsements, the Bored Apes collection has seen a substantial decrease in value, with factors such as waning retail interest and the rise of newer collections on Bitcoin and Solana contributing to the decline.

The broker interviewed the CEOs of Riot Platforms (RIOT), CleanSpark (CLSK), Marathon Digital (MARA), Cipher Mining (CIFR) and Hut 8 (HUT). The companies are in a relatively comfortable financial position this cycle and so are better prepared to withstand the impact of the halving, Bernstein said.

Another notable change this time round has been application and layer 2 development on the Bitcoin blockchain, which has led to an increase in network fees that flow back to miners as incremental revenue streams, the report noted.

The legislation mandates the official registration of all data centers, requiring information about their owners, leaders, and the digital services they provide. Norway becomes the first European nation to establish such a comprehensive framework.

Norway's move to regulate data centers follows the country's concerns over large greenhouse gas emissions associated with crypto mining. Terje Aasland, Norway's Minister of Energy, stated that they are not interested in businesses seeking to exploit Norway for cheap energy extraction. The primary objective of this legislation is to provide politicians with a clearer understanding of data centers in their municipalities. Aasland emphasized that the aim is to regulate the industry and have the ability to reject undesirable projects.

While the legislation is not explicitly targeted at Bitcoin miners, it could potentially lead to increased scrutiny for them. This comes at a time when Bitcoin miners are already preparing for the upcoming halving event, which will reduce block issuance rewards by half, potentially impacting the profitability of mining operations. Currently, numerous Bitcoin mining firms are operating in northern Norway, attracted by the region's low electricity costs. A report from local media outlet Dagsavisen in 2023 revealed that crypto mining firms in this area consume nearly as much electricity as the entire district of Lofoten.

While the government does not have an exact count of the number of Bitcoin mining firms in the country, the new legislation will provide valuable information to support Norway's digitalization plans.

Currently, Bitcoin's market for fungible tokens is considerably smaller compared to ETH and SOL. However, with the launch of the more efficient Runes token standard, Bitcoin has the potential to bridge this gap.

The report by Franklin Templeton acknowledges the role of the BRC-20 standard in the proliferation of fungible tokens on Bitcoin.

Other factors contributing to those returns include the recent approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs and the upcoming halving of Bitcoin mining rewards, estimated to occur on April 16, 2024.

Several Wall Street analysts think those factors will drive the cryptocurrency even higher in the future, but Anthony Scaramucci, Tom Lee, and Cathie Wood are among the most bullish. Their forecasts imply upside ranging from 525% to 5,800% from the current price of $64,000.

The two catalysts that could drive Bitcoin higher
Recently approved spot Bitcoin ETFs offer direct exposure to Bitcoin without the friction of cryptocurrency exchanges. That could be a game changer. By letting investors consolidate accounts (i.e., no separate accounts for cryptocurrency) and eliminating high transaction fees, spot Bitcoin ETFs could greatly increase demand.

Meanwhile, Bitcoin mining rewards will be reduced by 50% in April 2024. Halving events are coded into the blockchain protocol to ensure Bitcoin supply never exceeds 21 million, and they occur about once every four years. The upshot is that, by cutting issuance in half, the event will leave miners with 50% less Bitcoin to sell over the next four years, thereby diminishing selling pressure.

Anthony Scaramucci: $400,000 per Bitcoin (525% upside)
Anthony Scaramucci is the founder and managing partner at SkyBridge Capital, an alternative asset manager that specializes in hedge funds, digital assets, private equity, and real estate. Scaramucci was an early investor in the iShares Bitcoin ETF by BlackRock, and he made a few interesting comments during an interview with YouTube host Scott Melker earlier this year.

When questioned about his prediction that Bitcoin could exceed $170,000 by 2025, Scaramucci called it a data-dependent estimate based on Bitcoin consistently quadrupling during the 18-month period following halving events. Reuters quoted a similar comment from Scaramucci ahead of the World Economic Forum's meeting in January. ""Whatever the price is on the day of the halving in April, multiply it by four, and it'll reach that price in the next 18 months.""

In the past 7 days, Toncoin experienced a significant surge of 42.3%, propelling its market cap to an impressive $25 billion, just $2 billion behind Dogecoin.

Toncoin, which was transferred to the open-source community after Telegram dropped the project, has been making waves in the crypto market recently. The recent price surge is likely fueled by rumors of Telegram going public.

Speculation about a potential initial public offering (IPO) has been circulating for some time. In March, Telegram CEO Pavel Durov revealed in an interview with Business Insider that the company had received offers valuing it at over $30 billion, but Durov expressed more interest in pursuing a direct IPO.

Another factor contributing to Toncoin's growing popularity is the Notcoin game, which has boosted engagement with the TON ecosystem. The game rewards users who interact with the TON-based projects by installing wallets, purchasing NFTs, and upgrading Telegram accounts, among other activities. Toncoin recently surpassed Cardano (ADA) in terms of market capitalization, with ADA currently valued at $20 billion.

Probably not, but after booking losses toward the end of last week that were significant at times, the landscape looked a little better for altcoins.

On Monday, quite a few were posting comparatively modest losses, with some even inching cautiously into positive territory. In late afternoon trading, Chainlink (CRYPTO: LINK) was down only marginally, while The Sandbox's (CRYPTO: SAND) price was moving sideways. On the gainer side, VeChain (CRYPTO: VET) was up by 3.5%, and Litecoin (CRYPTO: LTC) posted a 0.5% gain.

Spot crypto ETFs apparently approved in a major Asian market
Major geopolitical developments usually impact the financial markets to some degree, and cryptocurrency is no exception to this. After a scare that the ever-volatile Middle East dynamic would worsen with Iran's attack on Israel, as of late afternoon Monday, the situation seemed to be cooling off encouragingly.

A more direct source of cautious optimism was the apparent approval of spot crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in Hong Kong, one of the most important financial markets in Asia. Asset managers there said the enclave's Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) gave its first nod to Bitcoin and Ethereum spot ETFs that day, although it was unclear how many or which ones were approved.

The move echoed the U.S. SEC's approval of such securities back in January, which lit quite a fire under the price not only of Bitcoin, but those of a great many altcoins. Crypto bulls were rightly encouraged that if the SEC is favorable to spot Bitcoin ETFs, approvals for altcoin ones are sure to follow.

This occurred on the week widely expected to witness the latest halving of Bitcoin. As the name implies, halving will see the Bitcoin payouts for mining the cryptocurrency reduced by half (a measure that helps control the ultimately limited supply of the coin). History shows that Bitcoin's price tends to rise after halving, so in recent weeks investors have piled into it on anticipation of similar gains.

Watch Hong Kong in the coming days
So, for the most part, investors were cautious as the trading week kicked into gear. We should bear in mind that on a year-to-date basis, many of the top cryptos have risen sharply in value, and in such situations, people tend to worry that they've soared too high.

Regardless, there is much interest in coins and tokens these days, so perhaps a renewed rally is in store. It would be worthwhile to keep an eye on those Hong Kong spot crypto ETFs; if interest in that market is anywhere near what the U.S. experienced, it could provide a nice driver pushing crypto prices upward again.",Bitcoin

For AI cryptos, these moves have been even more exaggerated.

As of 2:15 p.m. ET on Monday, The Graph (CRYPTO: GRT), Fetch.ai (CRYPTO: FET), and SingularityNET (CRYPTO:AGIX) are still up meaningfully, surging 5.6%, 2%, and 1.8%, respectively, over the past 24 hours. However, many of these tokens have continued to decline in afternoon trading alongside other risk assets, as Middle East tensions rise.

For AI cryptos, geopolitical concerns shouldn't matter to the same degree as with other assets that are more sensitive to capital flows. That said, capital flows do matter regardless of which niche a given project is pursuing, and selling pressure remains strong today.

What's driving these AI cryptos higher today?
Fetch.ai and SingularityNET are two projects uniquely focused on AI that have a shared catalyst that investors are clearly pricing in. Fetch.ai is collaborating with SingularityNET and Ocean Protocol to create what they're calling the ""Superintelligence Alliance.""

As part of this alliance, some talks around a potential token merger have taken place, with investors now pricing these tokens in high correlation to each other.

That certainly makes sense, given the AI focus of both projects, and their collaborative ties to work together on solving much bigger problems than they likely could on their own. One thing that certainly stands out to me about crypto assets is the relative lack of willingness for projects to merge. If these projects do tie the knot at some point, it will be interesting to see how the market values a token combination.

The demand for blockchain-based AI solutions appears to be strong, and a combination of these two relatively small-cap projects could improve their chances of success in creating meaningful utility for end users.

The Graph's core model as an oracle network, allowing off-blockchain data to be ported on-chain, has seen impressive demand build over time. A number of recent collaborations and partnerships have driven an impressive amount of momentum in this token over the past week. The fact that this momentum has continued is a very positive development for long-term investors, and suggests this AI-related play could have more room to run.

Following the conditional authorization, to become officially listed, the asset managers issuing the products will apply to Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing, the SFC added.

Initial approvals—conditional on products satisfying certain requirements and conditions—have been given to Harvest Global Investments and a partnership between HashKey Capital and Bosera Asset Management (International), according to separate statements from the companies. The Hong Kong unit of China Asset Management announced it has also received approval from the SFC to provide virtual asset management services and is allocating resources to develop the products. In a statement, OSL Digital Securities said it would provide custodial services for the products.

Since the approval of 10 U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs on Jan. 11, the products have been a hit, with over $56.2 billion assets under management helping Bitcoin reach an all-time high of $73,737.94 in March, according to CoinGecko data. Two leading Bitcoin ETFs, BlackRock’s IBIT and Fidelity’s FBTC, are among the top-performing 0.1% of roughly 5,500 ETFs that have launched over the past 30 years, Bloomberg data shows.

Experts told Fortune that excitement surrounding the news is inevitable, as Hong Kong is a special administrative region of China, the world’s second-largest economy, which banned all cryptocurrency transactions in September 2021. Moreover, as a result of stagnating equity markets in China, a record amount of Chinese money is flowing into overseas equities. Inflows into 33 onshore ETFs that track foreign benchmarks reached $2 billion in January, according to Bloomberg data, the biggest month since late 2020.

However, if the crypto industry is hopeful that the new Hong Kong ETFs could soon be flooded with Chinese investors looking to gain exposure to banned crypto and escape domestic stock markets, they may want to think again, experts said.

“A lot of people are banking on wealthy Chinese locals, but, officially, you cannot buy this ETF if you're a mainland Chinese investor,” said Eric Balchunas, a senior ETF analyst at Bloomberg. That’s because it must be listed on something called the Stock Connect, which allows Chinese citizens to invest in certain Hong Kong ETFs, and vice versa.

“This will never be available there,” says Balchunas.

As most foreign investors don’t have access to U.S. ETFs, Balchunas sees the most action coming from the likes of domestic retail investors, meaning inflows likely will pale in comparison to those seen in the American market. That’s because Hong Kong’s ETF market was worth about $50 billion—compared with some $8.87 trillion in the U.S.—at the end of the first quarter.

Balchunas sees interest in the Hong Kong products matching that of the U.S.—an ostensibly bullish prediction—which means the products could occupy 0.5% to 1% of the total ETF market, roughly $500 million to $1 billion. “It's a good additive,"" he noted, ""but numbers-wise, it’s going to be nickels and dimes compared to the U.S.""

Some call bitcoin a ""bubble"" while others don't see demand from clients and therefore, have no reason to participate in the alternative asset class.

Around the time it turned 15 and following years of scoffing by others on Wall Street, Bitcoin in 2023 won acceptance from one of the most powerful investors in the world, BlackRock. Other traditional finance firms had endorsed the original cryptocurrency, to be sure, but BlackRock's blessing – in the form of filing to create a spot bitcoin ETF and vocal praise from CEO Larry Fink – was widely viewed as a surprising and significant turn of events.

The tone around bitcoin {{BTC}} seemed to shift among finance professionals – at least some of them – in the aftermath, with more players voicing support.

And, yet, earlier this month at an event in Miami for investment pros, it was clear that a significant swath of the industry continues to have serious doubts about bitcoin.

That skepticism doesn't translate into Simplify completely ignoring bitcoin, however. It offers customers two funds that are exposed to BTC: the Simplify Bitcoin Strategy PLUS Income ETF and the Simplify US Equity PLUS GBTC ETF, which invests 10% of its assets in the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC).

To understand the recent turbulence in Bitcoin's price, we must first acknowledge the context of its remarkable ascent. Maintaining momentum from an impressive 2023, Bitcoin defied expectations in early 2024 by surging to an all-time high before the next halving, a feat the cryptocurrency had never accomplished.

The euphoria surrounding its astronomical rise inevitably led to a period of profit-taking. Based on data from blockchain analytics platform Glassnode, Bitcoin is currently experiencing its most extensive selloff by long-term holders since early 2021.

This profit-taking was exacerbated as fears of conflict between Israel and Iran transpired over the weekend. Bitcoin has since recouped some of its recent losses, with its price hovering around the $63,000 mark.

A necessary grain of salt
Despite the short-term fluctuations and pronounced volatility, it's essential to zoom out and consider the broader picture of Bitcoin's journey. One of the most significant developments in the cryptocurrency market this year has been the approval of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). In January, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission approved the launch of 11 spot Bitcoin ETFs, providing deep-pocketed institutional investors with direct access to the cryptocurrency market. This landmark decision was long awaited and represents a significant step forward in Bitcoin's mainstream adoption.

The next largest by that metric are Ether, stablecoin Tether, the Binance exchange’s native token BNB, and Solana.

The batch of three-month-old US spot ETFs from issuers including BlackRock Inc. and Fidelity Investments have amassed about $56 billion in assets to date, ranking as one of the most successful debuts ever for a fund category.

The inflows helped propel Bitcoin to a mid-March record of $73,798. While the token has retreated roughly 6% since then, a gauge of smaller digital assets has sunk more than 30%. The drop coincided with reduced expectations for the kind of looser US monetary policy settings that can fuel speculative gains.

Institutional Demand

Allocations to the US ETFs by institutional investors have “resulted in Bitcoin performing very strongly relative to the rest of the market,” said Benjamin Celermajer, director at digital-asset investment manager Magnet Capital.

One company, the decentralized AI marketplace Bittensor, has emerged as a magnet for prominent venture capital firms—Polychain, Digital Currency Group, and dao5 have bought up hundreds of millions of dollars worth of the project's token, TAO, which powers an array of AI-related services offered by the network such as model training and data storage.

While Bittensor's token was previously available only through mining, mid-tier exchanges, and over-the-counter markets, Binance and Crypto.com both listed TAO for trading last week, a major step forward for the little-known project, which is currently hovering near a market cap of $3.7 billion.

In an interview with Fortune, Bittensor founder Jacob Steeves said that the rise of centralized tools out of OpenAI, Google, and Meta has validated his project, which he began working on in 2015, even as Bittensor fights off accusations of capitalizing on the AI craze. ""It's the most amazing feeling as a builder,"" Steeves said. ""Frankenstein—it's alive.""

View this interactive chart on Fortune.com

VC backing
Bittensor doesn't have the mainstream cachet of crypto projects like the Sam Altman-backed Worldcoin, which seeks to mitigate the effects of AI by creating a crypto-enabled, eyeball-scanning protocol for verifying people's humanity—and which has raised over $200 million in venture funding.

Still, Bittensor has quietly attracted investors. The VC firm Polychain, founded by early Coinbase employee Olaf Carlson-Wee, incubated Bittensor in 2019 and holds around $200 million in Bittensor's token, according to people familiar with the investment.

""Bittensor uses an incentive system conceptually similar to Bitcoin mining, but instead of building a payment network, it builds an open-source and public artificial intelligence,"" Carlson-Wee said in a statement shared with Fortune, though he declined to provide specifics on Polychain's investment. ""It is a radical new use case for blockchains that is unprecedented.""

Dao5, an investment fund founded by Polychain alum Tekin Salimi, holds a stake in TAO around $50 million and was an early supporter of Bittensor's ecosystem, according to a person familiar with the investment.

Digital Currency Group, the influential and beleaguered crypto empire founded by Barry Silbert, is another backer and holds around $100 million of TAO, according to a person familiar with the investment. A spokesperson for DCG declined to comment. In a Business Insider article from 2021, DCG investor Matthew Beck recommended Bittensor as one of the 53 most promising crypto startups.

The flood of investor support demonstrates the unheralded ascent of Bittensor, which was founded years before the November 2022 debut of ChatGPT drove public awareness of generative AI. Bittensor's network launched in 2021.

Today, the intersection of crypto and AI is one of the hottest areas for speculation, with tokens such as Worldcoin fluctuating in price against news cycles around artificial intelligence. In late March, three of the biggest crypto AI projects announced they would create a collective and merge their tokens.

While some on X have referred to Bittensor's TAO token as a memecoin riding the wave of hype around AI, with its price increasing more than 1,000% in less than a year, Steeves told Fortune that Bittensor's track record demonstrates it is building a viable competitor to OpenAI and Google, where he previously worked as an engineer.

""People will come and they will go, and if they buy it because it's a memecoin, they won't be here later,"" he said. ""That's fine, because we want people that actually know what we're doing.""

Decentralized AI
Steeves said that he first got the idea for Bittensor looking at the Bitcoin network in 2015. Created by the pseudonymous Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoin leverages an innovation called mining to record and process transactions, creating an alternative to payment platforms without a single person or institution at the core. Instead, the system relies on code and a complex array of players from developers to validators who determine the direction of the protocol. ""How did we create a supercomputer that is bigger than any government or corporation can create with a centralized entity,"" Steeves said. ""The answer is Bitcoin used incentive mechanisms.""

Bittensor arose as an attempt to repurpose the mechanics around Bitcoin for the vast assembly of functions needed for the emergent field of AI, from data storage to training machine learning models. Many crypto projects ""pre-mine"" tokens, or create coins before the project is released, or otherwise allocate holdings to early backers through investment vehicles like SAFTs, or Simple Agreements for Future Tokens. Steeves chose the pure Bitcoin route, with participants only able to earn TAO tokens through mining, similar to Nakamoto's design.

Despite sharing Bitcoin's DNA, Bittensor's underlying system is far more complicated, with the network providing different types of functions than Bitcoin's simple transaction model, and miners engaging in different types of competitions depending on which function they are providing and incentivized by earning TAO. These different tools are split across 32 ""subnets,"" or specialized networks, that offer services like data storage, access to other AI-powered chatbots, scraping, and pricing oracles.

If that seems excessively esoteric, you're not alone—Bittensor's convoluted design is a function of its growing pains, and its struggle to explain itself to the public has helped stoke fears of its ""memecoin"" status. Still, the project has an impassioned community of stakeholders, ranging from miners and validators to projects building on Bittensor. Steeves highlighted Corcel, an AI company that has created products including a chatbot powered by Bittensor, as an example of early real-world applications emerging from the protocol.

Aside from the backing of VC firms like Polychain, other prominent companies are also supporting Bittensor by acting as validators, which help guide the development of subnets through their TAO holdings. Foundry, the DCG-owned Bitcoin mining giant, runs a subnet that incentives miners to predict the S&P 500 price index during trading hours.",Bitcoin
https://finance.yahoo.com/news/green-bitcoin-mining-strategic-path-145735226.html,Green Bitcoin Mining – A Strategic Path Forward in Diverse Regulatory Landscapes,"At the start of January 2024, the Bitcoin mining sector hit a significant milestone with its sustainable energy usage peaking at over 50%. This achievement is more than simply a nod to the greening efforts within the cryptocurrency space – it’s a loud proclamation of Bitcoin mining’s evolving ethos. Powered by an increased adoption of renewable energy sources, the industry is not only dialing down its environmental impact but also unlocking new vistas in green energy revenue. A seminal study from Cornell University has thrown the spotlight on an intriguing potential: Bitcoin mining operations could be the knight in shining armor for early-stage renewable energy projects, providing a financial lifeline by monetizing surplus power. This notion is gaining traction in the U.S., especially in renewable energy possibilities, promising to trim the carbon footprint of cryptocurrencies while fast-tracking renewable infrastructure’s growth.

But it’s the geographical agnosticism of Bitcoin mining that truly sets the stage for its green revolution. The sector’s mobility allows it to migrate to locales brimming with unused renewable energy, leveraging the stable bounty of hydro and geothermal sources over the fickle nature of wind and solar. A case in point is Gryphon Digital Mining’s operation in upstate New York, a leader with 100% renewable energy reliance amidst the broader discourse on mining’s environmental toll. This initiative doesn’t just underline the feasibility of sustainable mining, it showcases the sector’s potential as a catalyst for local economies and energy infrastructure development.

Regulatory Hurdles and the Path Forward

However, this green transition is not without its challenges, with regulatory hurdles forming the crux of the debate. The mining sector finds itself at a regulatory crossroads, where the clarity and stability of policies are paramount. Proposals abound, from awarding carbon credits for emissions reduction to the more contentious idea of taxing crypto miners. There’s a collective push toward harnessing the built-in economic incentives of Bitcoin mining to encourage sustainable practices, thus circumventing the necessity for heavy-handed regulatory measures.

This juncture signals a call for regulatory clarity, yes, but it also depicts the urgent need for the mining industry to adapt and commit to renewable energy. The time is ripe for a concerted effort to pivot towards greener practices, aligning with global sustainability goals, and for the mining sector to redefine its role in the energy ecosystem.

A Diverse Regulatory Landscape

The U.S. cryptocurrency mining landscape is a patchwork of regulatory frameworks, but one trend is unmistakably clear: the future of Bitcoin mining is inexorably tied to renewable energy. In states like Texas, the convergence of deregulated energy markets with substantial renewable energy projects has positioned it as a one of the more notable proponents for the industry’s sustainable future. This is a strategic alignment with the economic and environmental zeitgeist. Texas’s ERCOT grid, with its flexible electricity pricing and significant renewable capacity, exemplifies how the mining sector and renewable energy development can symbiotically thrive​​. Adding to this trend, Missouri’s recent legislative proposal by State Rep. Phil Christofanelli aims to bolster the state as a hub for Bitcoin mining, promising economic growth and aligning with a national shift toward sustainable mining practices. This move, alongside significant industry expansions in Texas, highlights a nationwide momentum toward integrating Bitcoin mining with renewable energy.

Although the narrative is significantly different in states like New York, its partial bans on carbon-dependent Bitcoin mining prove the notion that there is a growing environmental consciousness and an acknowledgment that the urgent need for sustainable energy solutions in the mining sector is imminent​​. Meanwhile, Wyoming’s regulatory environment has cultivated a fertile ground for digital asset companies, signaling a broader industry shift towards greener pastures – both literally and figuratively​.

Globally, the pivot toward renewable energy in Bitcoin mining has also gained momentum, especially following China’s 2021 crackdown which sent miners scattering across the globe in search of welcoming jurisdictions. Ethiopia has emerged as a new destination in this global diaspora, offering low electricity costs and an inviting regulatory landscape for mining operations. The nation’s increased ties with China, coupled with the construction of the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam, emphasize a strategic pivot to renewable sources of power for mining operations, mirroring a global trend towards sustainability​.

Redefining the Narrative of Bitcoin Mining

While mainstream media narratives often paint Bitcoin miners as environmental villains, the unfolding data narrative tells a markedly different tale. Far from being meager energy consumers, there’s a growing body of evidence highlighting how Bitcoin mining operations are becoming pivotal to supporting local economies and enhancing the resilience of grid infrastructures. These operations are adopting greener practices at an unprecedented rate and proving to be beneficial allies in the broader push toward renewable energy and sustainable development.

This essay is part of CoinDesk’s “Future of Bitcoin” package published to coincide with the fourth Bitcoin “halving” in April 2024.

The limitations of the ""Bitcoin only"" approach
Proponents of the ""Bitcoin only"" narrative often argue passionately for the superiority of bitcoin over other cryptocurrencies. However, this approach can come across as confrontational and off-putting to those who are new to the concept. When people feel attacked or told that their current investments are wrong, they are more likely to disengage from the conversation entirely. This is particularly true in countries like Turkey, where many individuals are already familiar with alternative investments like altcoins.

The power of education
To effectively promote bitcoin adoption, the focus should shift from telling people what to do to providing them with the knowledge to make informed decisions. By presenting bitcoin as the first step in understanding the broader cryptocurrency landscape, educators can help people grasp the unique features and advantages of bitcoin without disparaging other investments outright.

When individuals learn about the Bitcoin network's decentralized nature, its limited supply and its potential as a store of value, they can better appreciate its significance. This foundation of knowledge allows them to evaluate other cryptocurrencies more critically and recognize the authenticity of bitcoin's value proposition.

Instead, as the weekend’s sudden price drop showed, investors are more inclined to dump Bitcoin than to buy it. Meanwhile, gold—which many view as the original and ultimate store of value—ticked up at the height of the weekend’s crisis.

It’s true that Bitcoin’s sudden drop was fueled by a wave of liquidations as traders, some of whom were leveraged 50x or more, couldn’t cover their positions after prices first dipped on the war news, which led to still more selloffs. In contrast to these short-term traders, there are many more people holding Bitcoin for the long term—and it’s a safe bet few of them sold or were even tempted to do so.

Still, this doesn’t change the fact that amid the latest geopolitical crisis, more people chose to sell Bitcoin than buy it. The broader market treated Bitcoin as a risky asset to flee in favor of traditional safe havens like gold, bonds, and the U.S. dollar. Regardless of whether the broader market view is correct, that’s what happened when Iran started firing missiles.

Even though Bitcoin, for now at least, can’t claim to be an economic safe haven, this weekend’s events show that the crypto markets may serve as something else—an early warning signal. Unlike traditional markets, crypto exchanges operate around the clock. Meanwhile, many people in the crypto world follow geopolitical events closely. These conditions mean that crypto prices are among the first to respond to major news events and, when those events occur outside market hours, could serve as a good predictor for what will happen at the opening bell. No doubt people are already working on trading algorithms to do just that.",Bitcoin

Bitcoin gained on Monday, adding 3% after dropping to as low as $61,300 over the weekend. The weekend’s drop was due to geopolitical tensions, according to some analysts. Matteo Greco, a research analyst at Fineqia, said: “The weekend's price drop was attributed to geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, with market sentiment improving after an announcement regarding a temporary halt in hostilities among the involved nations.” He also noted that the upcoming bitcoin halving, could trigger a short-term “sell the news” reaction before and after the event.

Bitcoin and other major tokens began to recover from weekend losses, with BTC trading around $66,600 in European morning hours, buoyed by claims of approval of spot bitcoin and ether ETFs in Hong Kong.

The market-wide decline had been caused by profit-taking ahead of the bitcoin halving and macroeconomic tremors, leading to the liquidation of over $2 billion in futures positions and a drop in open interest as bets were closed.

Meme coins and artificial intelligence (AI)-linked tokens led gains in the past 24 hours as bitcoin and other major tokens started to reverse weekend losses.

The Conservative-party-led government has said it wants to make the U.K. a global hub for crypto and passed legislation last year to recognize crypto and stablecoins as regulated financial activities in the country.

The U.K. government is set to put forward legislation for stablecoins as well as for crypto staking, exchange and custody by June or July, Economic Secretary Bim Afolami said at the Innovate Finance Global Summit on Monday.

""We are now working at pace to deliver the legislation to put our final proposals for our regime in place,"" Afolami said. ""Once it goes live, a whole host of crypto asset activities, including operating an exchange, taking custody of customers’ assets and other things, will come within the regulatory perimeter for the first time.""

In 2023, the U.K. passed a landmark financial markets bill that laid the foundation for stablecoins and crypto broadly to be treated as regulated financial activities in the country. Local regulators, the Financial Conduct Authority and the Bank of England, both consulted on what a stablecoin regime would look like last February. The BoE said it would oversee stablecoin providers that were large enough to affect the financial system, while the FCA said it would regulate the wider crypto space.

Afolami teased the coming of secondary stablecoin legislation in February, adding that the government was pushing to get it done within six months.

The U.K.’s Conservative Party-led government has said it wanted to be a crypto hub and has since consulted on its ambitions to regulate crypto.

The lack of whale participation in the recovery means whales likely expect a deeper price slide. Bitcoin fell over 5% last week as the rally in the dollar index and Iran-Israel tensions triggered an outflow of money from risk assets like stocks and cryptocurrencies and into gold.

RJ Fulton, The Motley Fool
Mon, April 15, 2024 at 3:05 PM GMT+5:30
Up more than 50% in 2024 and an astounding 200% since the beginning of 2023, it's safe to say crypto is officially back. Today, the collective market cap of the asset class sits at roughly $2.6 trillion. Yet, one CEO thinks it still has plenty of room to run.

In a recent interview with CNBC, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse, whose company created the XRP (CRYPTO: XRP) cryptocurrency, pointed to several macroeconomic factors that could converge in 2024 and help push the total crypto market to $5 trillion, a near doubling from today's prices. While perhaps coming off as sensational, he might just be right.

A person looking shocked in front of computer monitors.

Institutions are piling into Bitcoin
The overarching reason for Garlinghouse's belief that the crypto market will double in 2024 is related to institutional interest. For most of crypto's history, its ascension as an asset class was driven by retail investors like you and me. But over the last few years, and specifically in 2024, the long-awaited arrival of deep-pocketed institutional investors slowly began to take shape.

In January, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved 11 spot Bitcoin ETFs, effectively giving Wall Street direct access to the cryptocurrency, something previously not possible. With pent-up demand sidelined for years, the spot ETFs have generated massive trading volumes in just the first few months of trading and put a serious strain on Bitcoin's (CRYPTO: BTC) supply.

In just the month of March, firms backing these ETFs purchased three times the amount of Bitcoin mined during that stretch. Since their launch, the ETFs have attracted net inflows of more than $12 billion, making them one of the most successful groups of ETFs in history.

As Garlinghouse pointed out, this new demand is going to have to compete for a smaller supply after Bitcoin undergoes its fourth halving. Projected to occur on April 20, this halving will cut Bitcoin's inflation rate from roughly 1.75% to somewhere around 0.8%. Hinting at the near-inevitable price increase, which should occur after the halving, Garlinghouse commented that it ""doesn't take an economics major to tell you what happens when supply contracts and demand expands.""

Harvest Global Investments Ltd. and a partnership between HashKey Capital Ltd. and Bosera Asset Management (International) Co. announced initial approvals in separate statements on Monday.

The Hong Kong unit of China Asset Management said it had received approval from the city’s Securities & Futures Commission for the provision of virtual-asset management services and is deploying resources to develop products.

Hong Kong is vying with the likes of Singapore and Dubai to become a digital-asset hub after rolling out a dedicated regulatory regime last year. Officials are trying to restore the city’s reputation as a modern financial hub following a crackdown on dissent that dulled its allure.

Listing Approval Pending

The SFC said the agency issues a conditional authorization letter to an ETF application if it generally satisfies its requirements, subject to various conditions. An applicant would then apply to Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Ltd. for listing approval, the SFC added.

In a statement, OSL Digital Securities Ltd. said it would provide custodial services for Bitcoin and Ether products from the China Asset Management unit as well as Harvest.

The crypto market got a boost from the latest developments. Bitcoin rose as much as 4.3% and Ether 6.5%. The tokens traded at $66,232 and $3,253 respectively as of 4:30 p.m. Monday in Hong Kong.

Spot-crypto ETFs have been in the spotlight after Bitcoin funds from companies including BlackRock Inc. and Fidelity Investments debuted in the US in January. The portfolios have attracted a net inflow of $12.5 billion to date, demand that helped take the largest digital asset to a record high of $73,798 in mid-March. It’s unclear if the US will approve pending applications to start ETFs that directly hold second-ranked token Ether.

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/1-top-cryptocurrency-buy-soars-073200152.html,"1 Top Cryptocurrency to Buy Before It Soars 3,186%, According to Cathie Wood","Ark Invest, the asset manager headed by Cathie Wood, focuses on owning businesses that have major disruptive potential. The thinking is that innovative companies can lead to huge growth potential, resulting in attractive long-term investment returns.

The famed investor appreciates new technologies, so it's no surprise that her fund is also bullish on digital assets. To be more specific, there is one top cryptocurrency Cathie Wood believes could soar 3,186% to $2.3 million. Perhaps it's time you considered buying.

The bull case for Bitcoin
As the oldest, most valuable cryptocurrency, Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) gets a lot of attention. In more recent times, its price has surged, rising 325% since the start of 2023. This has placed an even brighter spotlight on the asset.

But Cathie Wood believes there is significantly more upside. In Ark Invest's Big Ideas 2024 research report, the firm's analysts could possibly see Bitcoin's price per coin getting to $2.3 million. That's a monster 33-fold gain from today's $70,000 level (as of the morning of April 11).

This lofty price target is based on the simple fact that Bitcoin will attract larger amounts of capital over time. Getting to $2.3 million implies that nearly 20% of the $250 trillion of global investible assets would find their way to Bitcoin.

This begs the question: Why would more investors want to buy and hold Bitcoin? I believe there is really one key reason the digital asset could become a mainstay in more portfolios.

It all has to do with scarcity. There will only ever be 21 million coins in circulation. Owning something that has a fixed supply cap seems like a smart move.

Cathie Wood and Ark Invest also argue that Bitcoin proved itself as a safe-haven asset, as its price rose meaningfully in 2023 following the regional banking crisis. Additionally, the firm believes that because of the ability to preserve capital, diversification benefits, and liquidity, Bitcoin can reduce risk for investors.

Should you be buying near all-time highs?
Bitcoin is currently in record territory. Naturally, some investors are probably wondering if now is still a good time to be buying the crypto. Cathie Wood thinks so.

That's because Bitcoin is benefiting from numerous catalysts at the moment. There's the recent approval of spot ETF products that puts somewhat of a stamp of approval on Bitcoin. The halving is coming up soon, which has historically been a bullish event that reduces new supply entering the market. And greater institutional acceptance, coupled with regulatory clarity, are also positive factors.

Ark Invest's research shows that any investors who purchased and held Bitcoin during any five-year stretch would have generated a profit. This is encouraging for those who have been on the sidelines and missed the current rally.

To be clear, though, investors should take the time to understand and learn more about this unique asset and its special characteristics. Only then can you build the conviction needed to be able to hold through the inevitable periods of heightened volatility.

If you do decide that it's time to buy Bitcoin for your own portfolio, consider adopting a dollar-cost averaging strategy. This eliminates the need to correctly time the market. Instead, you can purchase Bitcoin at regular intervals to take advantage of multiple entry points. Just be sure to maintain a very long-term mindset.

Cathie Wood's Bitcoin price target might seem incredibly lofty, and it's anyone's guess if this digital asset even gets remotely close to that level. But that doesn't mean you shouldn't consider buying this top crypto right now.",Bitcoin
https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bitcoin-halving-crypto-miners-racing-070000336.html,Bitcoin Halving Has Crypto Miners Racing for 'Epic Sat' Potentially Worth Millions,"This is the first bitcoin rewards halving in which value can be assigned to individual sats, which can now be traded like NFTs following last year's launch of the Ordinals protocol.

The first sat to be mined after this month's halving could theoretically attain a value of $1 million or more on marketplaces for digital collectibles.

""It's kind of a lottery ticket,"" said an executive of the crypto mining firm Marathon Digital.

With Bitcoin's fourth quadrennial ""halving"" now as little as a week away, cryptocurrency mining companies are jockeying to capture what could be the most valuable data block of all time, worth millions of dollars potentially.

Almost two years ago, Casey Rodarmor, creator of the Ordinals protocol atop the Bitcoin blockchain, developed a system for categorizing the rarity of individual satoshis, or ""sats"" – the smallest denomination of the digital asset, similar to cents on the dollar or pence on the pound.

This feature is part of CoinDesk's ""Future of Bitcoin,"" package published to coincide with the Halving in April 2024.

The reason for the system was because, following the launch of Ordinals in early 2023, these satoshis could be numbered and traded as if they were unique tokens. But each one could also be thought of as collectibles, or a non-fungible token (NFT). And as any collector knows, the price of a collector's item is often linked to its rarity.

Rodarmor's scale went from ""uncommon,"" the first sat of each block, all the way up to ""mythic,"" which is the first sat of the first-ever block on Bitcoin — presumably lodged safely in Bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto's possession. So don't even think about obtaining that.

Somewhere in between, but on the higher end of the scale, ranks the first sat after a Bitcoin rewards halving — the start of a new ""epoch,"" in the blockchain jargon. It is classed as ""epic."" Tristan, the founder of Ordiscan, thinks this sat could be ""conservatively"" valued at $50 million by prospective Ordinals enthusiasts.",Bitcoin

The geopolitical unrest resulted in more than US$1.5 billion in long position liquidations on Friday and Saturday, according to data from Coinglass.

The market’s reaction to the Iranian drone attack, which was itself a retaliation to an Israeli operation in Syria, underscores the high sensitivity of cryptocurrency investments to global events.

Bitcoin was down 5% from its price on Friday, while ether sank more than 7%, and XRP tumbled 13.5%, according to CoinMarketCap. That's a sign risk assets will be under pressure.

A fuller picture of Wall Street's reaction to Iran's first-ever, full-scale military assault on Israel will come on Sunday evening, when futures trading opens in the U.S. for stocks, bonds, commodities and currencies.

Trading on Friday offered somewhat of a preview on what to expect. Reports at the time said an Iranian attack on Israel was expected within two days, boosting U.S. benchmark oil prices as much as 3% to top $87 a barrel.

U.S. Treasury bonds also rallied sharply, sending the 10-year yield down as much as 10 basis points as investors looked for safety.

Similarly, the U.S dollar advanced as the geopolitical tensions caused investors to turn away from riskier emerging-market currencies.

Even the euro fell to a five-month low against the greenback, as markets also weighed the prospect of the European Central Bank cutting rates before the Federal Reserve does.

Meanwhile, prices for gold—traditionally seen as another safe-haven asset—surged to a fresh record high above $2,400 an ounce before later reversing those gains late Friday.

Stocks sold off on Friday, led by risk-on tech shares, as investors also digested bank earnings and fresh inflation data that further dampened hopes for imminent Fed rate cuts.

Mideast tensions have been ramping up since militants backed by Iran attacked Israel in October. Other Iranian-backed groups in Lebanon, Iraq, Syria and Yemen have also launched rockets at Israel.

More recently, Tehran blamed Israel for an April 1 airstrike in Syria that killed two Iranian generals, though Israel hasn't addressed it.

The decentralized finance (DeFi) sector has been hit particularly hard as a result of the market chaos, with depressed prices forcing liquidations and raising the potential of havoc for some protocols.

Among the protocols being closely watched is Ethena, the buzzy Ethereum project behind USDe, a ""synthetic dollar"" built to mirror the price of the US dollar. Ethena has attracted more than $2 billion in deposits, but it uses a controversial method for maintaining USDe's one-dollar ""peg"" that hasn't been tested under such adverse market conditions.

The immediate cause of Saturday's market declines was not clear, though former BitMEX CEO Arthur Hayes wrote in a blog post last week that dollar liquidity would drop right before tax payments are due in the U.S. on April 15 – this coming Monday. Lower liquidity would lead to lower prices, he said.

But over the past year, the crypto market warmed up again as the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved the first spot price Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and investors looked forward to lower interest rates.

The upcoming Bitcoin ""halving,"" which will reduce the rewards for mining the cryptocurrency; network upgrades for the Ethereum Network; and more institutional cryptocurrency purchases also brought back more bulls.

The easiest way to profit from the market's growth is to directly buy top cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum on a cryptocurrency exchange. But it's still smart to invest in a few promising crypto companies which will benefit from the same tailwinds. I believe Marathon Digital (NASDAQ: MARA) and Coinbase Global (NASDAQ: COIN) check all the right boxes.

1. Marathon Digital
Marathon Digital is North America's largest pure-play Bitcoin miner. It minted 12,852 Bitcoins in 2023, a 210% jump from 2022. At the end of March, it held 17,381 Bitcoins within its $1.6 billion in total Bitcoin and cash holdings.

Marathon's mining operations in North Dakota were affected by adverse weather conditions in the first quarter of 2024. But it plans to resolve those issues by shifting some of its miners from North Dakota to Texas and energizing thousands of new miners. After making those changes, it expects its operating fleet grow to 235,000 miners with a total production capacity of 29.8 exahashes per second (EH/s) this year. By comparison, Marathon's closest competitor, Riot Platforms, ended March with 112,944 miners, a production capacity of 8.6 EH/s, and only 8,490 Bitcoins on its balance sheet.

Marathon's lead over Riot should widen as it opens new plants, acquires smaller miners, and expands its new mining joint venture in Abu Dhabi. It's also periodically selling its own Bitcoin to raise more cash and support those expansion plans.

Analysts expect Marathon's revenue to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 35% from 2023 to 2026. They expect its adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) to grow at a slower CAGR of 1% as it ramps up its spending to scale up its business, but its stock still looks reasonably valued at 6 times this year's sales and 13 times its adjusted EBITDA.

2. Coinbase Global
Coinbase is one of the world's largest cryptocurrency exchanges. It held $101 billion in assets under custody at the end of 2023, and it was chosen as the custodian for eight of the 11 new Bitcoin spot price ETFs that went public earlier this year. It also flourished as many of its industry peers collapsed.

Coinbase's total trading volume declined 44% in 2023, but it still improved sequentially in the third and fourth quarters as the crypto market warmed up again. It's also been generating more of its trading revenue from the Tether stablecoin -- which accounted for 11% of its trading volume in 2023 -- and that shift could reduce its long-term dependence on Bitcoin, Ethereum, and its other more volatile crypto assets.

From 2023 to 2026, analysts expect Coinbase's revenue to grow at a CAGR of 21% as its adjusted EBITDA increases at a CAGR of 40%. Based on those estimates, its stock trades at 10 times this year's sales and 24 times its adjusted EBITDA.

Coinbase's stock isn't a screaming bargain yet, but it could still have plenty of room to run as the cryptocurrency market expands. That's why Ark Invest's Cathie Wood -- who believes Bitcoin's price can hit $1.5 million within the next three years -- holds Coinbase as a top holding across several of Ark Invest's most popular ETFs. If you believe cryptocurrencies will gain more attention from retail and institutional investors, you should follow Ark's lead and pick up a few shares of Coinbase.",Bitcoin
https://finance.yahoo.com/news/looking-save-more-1-million-100400585.html,Looking to Save More Than $1 Million for Retirement? 2 Cryptos to Buy Now and Hold for Decades,"According to the latest survey on money and retirement from Northwestern Mutual, the amount needed by Americans to retire comfortably continues to rise. It has now increased to $1.46 million, which is up 15% from last year, and a whopping 53% from 2020. What makes that number particularly daunting is that the average amount saved for retirement is just $88,400.

Having less than $100,000 saved for retirement could work if you have a 25-year time horizon to grind out steady 10% annualized gains. But what if you have less time to make up ground? Or what if you have significantly less than $88,400 saved for retirement?

If that's the case, you might want to think about investing in cryptocurrencies, which have the potential to increase your money 10-fold within a short time horizon.

Bitcoin
Although Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) is not for everyone, there is no denying that it has the sort of high-octane fuel needed to deliver 10-fold returns. During the period from 2011-2021, Bitcoin was the top-performing asset in the world, and it wasn't even close.

Bitcoin delivered annualized returns of 230% per year. The next closest asset class -- high-growth tech stocks -- delivered just 20%. That helps to explain why Bitcoin has gone from being a $1 asset in 2011 to a $70,000 asset today.

While past performance is no guarantee of future results, the growing consensus on Wall Street is that Bitcoin still has a lot more room to run. Future price forecasts range from $100,000 on the low side to more than $3.8 million on the high side. And, according to Cathie Wood of Ark Invest, Bitcoin is now highly likely to hit a $1 million price tag before the year 2030, due to all the money flowing into the new spot Bitcoin ETFs.

So you can see where I'm going with this. If you spend $70,000 today to buy a single Bitcoin, then you could (theoretically) have a nice little $1 million retirement nest egg by the end of the decade.

Of course, this is a highly risky strategy, and not one that any responsible financial planner would ever propose. After all, Bitcoin remains a highly volatile asset. Overnight, your retirement savings could vanish into thin air, or the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) could decide to regulate Bitcoin out of existence.

However, the new spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) will likely help popularize using Bitcoin to save for retirement. Fidelity Investments has already opened up some retirement accounts for Bitcoin, and it appears likely that Bitcoin is going to become an option in many 401(k) retirement plans. Most likely, these investment options will cap the amount that you can allocate to Bitcoin, but you can still use them to turbocharge your retirement savings.

Ethereum
If Bitcoin is the top crypto for retirement, then Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH) is the clear runner-up. Much like Bitcoin, Ethereum has an established track record of delivering performance to investors.

Back in April 2016, Ethereum was trading for less than $10. Now it's trading around $3,500. In less than a decade, you would have made 350-fold on your investment.

And Ethereum is not resting on its laurels. Ethereum underwent a major technological transformation (known as The Merge) in September 2022, and continues to make improvements to its underlying blockchain architecture to become faster, cheaper, and more scalable. By doing so, it is preparing for the next major wave of blockchain technology adoption, which will likely include large enterprises moving their operations over to the blockchain.

The current consensus is that Ethereum will become the second crypto to get its own spot ETF. Originally, the thinking was that this might occur by the end of May, but that is now looking increasingly unlikely. If the SEC does eventually approve a spot Ethereum ETF, then it will become much easier to save for retirement with Ethereum without needing to dip your toes directly into the crypto market.

Crypto for retirement?
Just a few years ago, the idea of using crypto to save for retirement would have been unthinkable. But as Wall Street launches more and more products for crypto investors, sentiment appears to be shifting. It doesn't hurt, of course, that both Bitcoin and Ethereum are near all-time highs right now, and that another crypto bull market rally appears to be underway.

Just keep in mind, however, that there is substantial risk in investing in crypto. As a result, crypto should never make up 100% of your retirement portfolio, and you certainly shouldn't be taking $70,000 out of your current retirement savings and using it to buy a single Bitcoin in the hopes of it soaring to $1 million. That would be a very expensive lottery ticket.

But, as they say, desperate times sometimes call for desperate measures. If you only have a few years left until retirement, or if you find yourself well behind what other Americans have saved for retirement, it could be time to boost your allocation to crypto to make up for lost ground.",Bitcoin
https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-many-altcoins-were-swooning-224206503.html,Why Many Altcoins Were Swooning This Week,"Sooner or later, even the most beloved financial assets obey gravity no matter how high they've soared. This week we saw a decline in a clutch of very recently soaring altcoins, as a higher-than-expected inflation readout and profit-taking hit the cryptocurrency market.

Over the course of the five trading weekdays, according to data compiled by S&P Global Market Intelligence, as of late Friday afternoon both Fantom (CRYPTO: FTM) and Theta Network (CRYPTO: THETA) were trading down by nearly 6% week to date. Bittensor (CRYPTO:TAO) was faring worse, with a more than 8% slide over the period.

Untamed inflation
One big monster in the room over the past few days was inflation, which came in higher than many had anticipated -- this beast might take a while to tame, after all. On Wednesday, the government's Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that inflation in March had risen by 3.5% year over year, which was 0.3 percentage points higher than the February figure and notably above the estimates of many economists.

Suddenly, there's much less talk of the interest rate cuts Federal Reserve (Fed) officials were hoping to start enacting this year.

The prospect of our current, relatively high rates dragging on for longer than expected is sobering to crypto investors. Lower rates make boring-but-safe investments more attractive, as instruments like bonds pay higher interest and become more competitive with the risky stuff. Despite their rising popularity and the belief some hold that they're ideal stores of value, ultimately cryptocurrencies have to be considered high on the risk scale.

At times, it can take a trading day or two for discouraging news to impact the market. The following Friday saw a wide sell-off of many crypto assets. This includes the Pied Piper behind which every altcoin hops, Bitcoin. That day alone, Bitcoin's price was headed south as of very late afternoon trading at a near 5% clip. And when Bitcoin's having a downer, your favorite altcoin is probably headed south, too.

Bargains coming?
Some economists are speculating darkly that we're in for more inflation ""surprises."" What isn't helping at the moment is the apparently insatiable demand for housing; the prices in this category rose notably in March.

Where does this leave cryptocurrency? Coins and tokens might be in for a reckoning, and we shouldn't be surprised to see a period of correction as investors get used to the current situation. That might, however, provide a nice entry point for crypto bulls -- if so, we should keep an eye on altcoins, as the more volatile ones could see outsized price gains on a rally.

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bitcoin-halving-ahead-3-cryptocurrencies-221700478.html,Bitcoin Halving Ahead: 3 Cryptocurrencies to Buy Now,"The upcoming Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) halving is one of the most anticipated events of the year for crypto investors -- and for good reason. Past halving cycles have led to stratospheric gains for Bitcoin, as well as new all-time highs. So naturally, all eyes are on Bitcoin right now.

But another interesting phenomenon occurs after the halving as well: Top altcoins tend to see a huge spike in market cap as they follow Bitcoin higher. And in fact, some of these coins actually outperform Bitcoin in the 12-month period after the halving.

With that in mind, here are three cryptocurrencies that have the potential to soar higher in 2024 and into 2025.

1. Solana
While Solana (CRYPTO: SOL) has cooled off considerably since its torrid 2023, when it increased in value by more than 900%, it is still keeping pace with Bitcoin in 2024. For the year, Bitcoin is up 66%, while Solana is up 67%.

Much of that has to do with the fact that Solana is now seen as ""the next Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH)."" As Cathie Wood of Ark Invest pointed out last November, Solana is basically a cheaper, faster, more efficient version of Ethereum. Thus, just as Ethereum was one of the top altcoin performers in the previous Bitcoin halving cycle, Solana could be one of the top altcoin performers in the next Bitcoin halving.

Add in the fact that Solana has a robust mobile crypto strategy, and this crypto really has a chance to differentiate itself in the upcoming bull market cycle. Unlike its rivals, Solana now has a mobile phone optimized for crypto. This is opening up all sorts of new opportunities, such as the ability to gain a much bigger share of the crypto gaming market.

2. Chainlink
Chainlink (CRYPTO: LINK) could be a sleeper candidate to outperform Bitcoin over the next 12 months. Yes, Chainlink is only up 15% year to date, but you have to look ahead to what's coming next to appreciate just how much higher it might soar in the next bull market cycle.

Chainlink is at the forefront of a long-term financial trend known as real-world asset tokenization. This refers to the process of converting real-world assets into digital assets that can live on the blockchain. You might not have heard of this trend yet, but a lot of big names on Wall Street are now solidly behind it, including BlackRock (NYSE: BLK), the largest asset manager in the world. According to the Boston Consulting Group, asset tokenization could be a $16 trillion market opportunity by 2030.

If Chainlink can grab just a tiny piece of this market opportunity, it could be huge for its future growth prospects. And there are plenty of reasons to think that it could.

For one, Chainlink is already the most trusted data oracle in the crypto world, providing real-world data for the pricing of financial assets. Secondly, Chainlink is working on a new blockchain protocol (known as CCIP, or Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol) for connecting blockchains. This would make it much easier for tokenized financial assets to be transferred across blockchains seamlessly.

3. SingularityNET
Finally, save room in your portfolio for a high-upside AI crypto. As Cathie Wood of Ark Invest emphasized in her 2024 ""Big Ideas"" report, there are a lot of opportunities happening at the intersection of artificial intelligence and crypto. Given all the enthusiasm around AI right now, it can be hard to cut through the hype, but one AI crypto that has me intrigued is SingularityNET (CRYPTO: AGIX).

AI computer chip.
Image source: Getty Images.
Unlike ChatGPT, which focuses on generative AI, SingularityNET focuses on artificial general intelligence (AGI). That's a much bigger market opportunity, and one that could be a complete game-changer for humanity.

I'm not exaggerating here. The token's name refers to ""the technological singularity"" -- the moment in time when a single computer becomes more intelligent than all of humanity combined. (Don't worry -- SingularityNET is working on a benevolent form of AGI that won't enslave humanity.)

While investing in any AI crypto comes with a huge risk factor, there are two factors that appear to make SingularityNET at least slightly less risky. For one, the team behind SingularityNET, led by AI researcher Ben Goertzel, is world-class. And, secondly, the current price of a SingularityNET token is just $1. That seems to be a very cheap price of admission to the exciting world of super-intelligent AI.

Not all altcoins are created equal
Just keep in mind that anytime you start dabbling in the world of altcoins, your risk exposure is going to increase dramatically. So be careful about expanding your exposure far beyond Bitcoin. With Bitcoin, there is at least a proven track record of success after the halving. Things get much dicier when it comes to cryptos in emerging areas, such as asset tokenization and artificial intelligence.

That being said, if you're looking to diversify your crypto portfolio with a few big winners in the post-halving cycle, three names at the top of my list are Solana, Chainlink, and SingularityNET",Bitcoin

Coinglass data show about $780 million worth of bullish crypto wagers were liquidated in the past 24 hours — the largest such drop in a month. The financial world was roiled on Friday by a flare-up in geopolitical risks that spurred a flight to the safest corners of the market such as bonds and the dollar.

Ether, the second-biggest cryptocurrency after Bitcoin, was down as much as 12% at one point, the biggest intraday decline since November 2022. It later pared the drop. The token has been under pressure since the Ethereum Foundation revealed last month that it was under scrutiny from the the US Securities and Exchange Commission.

“As cryptocurrencies across the board embrace correlation to risk assets, the slight decline in price quickly turned into an all-out cascade of liquidations,” said Chris Newhouse, DeFi analyst at Cumberland Labs.

Bitcoin fell as much as 7.5% to $65,214, before paring losses. Solana and Dogecoin slumped more, declining around 12% and 13%, respectively. Cardano and Polkadot each tumbled around 15%.

The sudden rout came on the back of rising Bitcoin prices in part driven by Bitcoin halving, a code update that has been perceived as a positive catalyst for the market as it will reduce the supply of the digital asset. Bitcoin is still up around 60% this year.

Ravi Doshi, head of markets at FalconX, said they’re now seeing buyers come in to take advantage of this opportunity ahead of the halving next week.

Even so, one of the options market’s closely watched indicators is starting to show that speculators are getting nervous ahead of the once-every-four-years Bitcoin code adjustment, which has been bullish for the cryptocurrency in the past. The halving is expected to take place around April 20.

The implied volatility for Bitcoin options jumped last weekend, reversing a downward trend seen in the prior week, Kaiko Research said in a report. An increase generally means market participants are less confident about the direction of prices, said Adam McCarthy, a research analyst at Kaiko. When implied volatility rises, traders are usually willing to pay more to protect existing positions or to speculate on potential prices moves — up or down.",Bitcoin
https://finance.yahoo.com/news/crypto-flash-crash-caused-fridays-210158498.html,Crypto Flash Crash: What Caused Friday's Collapse,"The crypto market took an absolute nosedive at 8:30 a.m. ET on Friday after the stock market opened. Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) has fallen over $4,000 in value to $66,440 as of 3:15 p.m. ET, Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH) is off 9% over the same time to $3,216, and Dogecoin (CRYPTO: DOGE) plunged 14.2%.

While the decline started early on Friday, it accelerated around noon ET -- that's when small declines became double-digit losses for many cryptocurrencies.

There weren't any major news items out of the crypto world today, but this kind of volatility can often hit at the end of the week or on the weekend. And for the first time in a while, that's what we got today.

A bad week for crypto
There wasn't a lot of good news for cryptocurrencies this week. Hotter-than-expected inflation reported earlier this week caused an increase in interest rates and a drop in tech and growth stocks, which have all traditionally correlated with falling crypto values. It just took a while for the market to process the news.

We also had the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issue a Wells notice to Uniswap, which is a precursor to legal action against the cryptocurrency. The market has been fighting to get clarity around what's legal and what's not, but the SEC has chosen legal actions against high-profile counterparties like XRP and Coinbase. Yet the SEC has also lost most of those battles, so it's not clear what the outcome of the latest ones will be.

With a lack of regulatory clarity, it's not surprising that some investors have chosen to take profits at a market peak.

Liquidations cause a rout on Friday
When a crash starts, it can be accelerated by the leverage in the crypto market. Not only do traders have leveraged positions, but the liquidity can also decline as the week ends, which could have exacerbated the situation on Friday.

According to Coinglass.com, there have been $668 million in long positions liquidated in the past four hours alone. Liquidations aren't unusual, but normally they're limited to a few hundred million dollars per day, not that level in just a few hours.

What's unique about this crash is the breadth. Not only are Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Dogecoin down, but smaller tokens are falling much more.

Volatility and the week ahead
The crypto market has always been volatile, but this is an abnormally large decline. It's not clear what will stop it.

Over the past few months, the market has benefited from billions of dollars of inflows to Bitcoin ETFs, which has caused speculators to lead the way and leverage to magnify moves. That's great on the way up, but if the trend reverses it could be terrible for crypto values.

I'm cautious about the short-term price moves in cryptocurrency because I think investors will be looking for safer investments as interest rates rise and earnings season begins. But this weekend may be the start of an especially volatile period for the industry.",Bitcoin

The implied volatility for Bitcoin options jumped last weekend, reversing a downward trend seen in the prior week, Kaiko Research said in a report. An increase generally means market participants are less confident about the direction of prices, said Adam McCarthy, a research analyst at Kaiko. When implied volatility rises, traders are usually willing to pay more to protect existing positions or to speculate on potential prices moves — up or down.

Bitcoin whipsawed investors on Friday, with the price swinging in a more than 8% range while global financial markets were roiled by a flare-up in geopolitical risks.

Implied volatility on contracts expiring in the next two weeks has increased the most, from 59% to 71% in the span of just 2 days, Kaiko said, suggesting that expectations for near-term volatility are rising.

“In this case it’s likely more bearish as traders are uncertain, but are willing to pay more for options to get protection against price swings,” McCarthy said. “They’re possibly paying high premiums to buy downward protection.”

After a mostly one-way surge in Bitcoin since the January approval of US exchange-traded funds to hold the cryptocurrency, the price has swung in a range in the past month. Traders are now focusing on what’s known as the halving, when the rewards in the form of additional tokens that so-called miners get for verifying transactions on the blockchain will be cut in half. The event is slated for around April 20.

“I think [the spike in Bitcoin expiries] is really related to people betting on the demand of Bitcoin on the day of the halving, where it will be even more expensive because the supply will be contracted,” said Bartosz Lipinski, founder and CEO of Cube Exchange. “It’s a very unique event in the Bitcoin history because you have two forces that effectively will be creating pressures on the price that’s already normally pretty inelastic.”

Previous halvings show short-term impact has been mixed, while the long-run has been bullish, another Kaiko report shows. In two out of the three previous halvings, prices surged one and three months afterward, the report explains. In all three halvings, prices surged nine and 12 months afterward.

However, Kaiko highlights that a sample size of three is not necessarily large enough to be conclusive, and researchers consider noted that other bullish events in the industry contributed to the gains.",Bitcoin
https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-uniswap-led-crypto-crash-192639416.html,Why Uniswap Led a Crypto Crash This Week,"The crypto market had a good week overall with Bitcoin and Ethereum rising by low-single-digit percentages until early morning on Friday. But at about 9 a.m. ET, the entire industry began to go into a tailspin.

According to data provided by S&P Global Market Intelligence, as of noon ET Friday, Dogecoin (CRYPTO: DOGE) was up by 9.5% over the past week but after a rapid decline of 10% in the last two hours, it's now down slightly for the week as of 3 p.m. ET. VeChain (CRYPTO: VET) was up 13.8%,  only to fall by 10.6% in the past 24 hours and is now up just 3.2% for the week. Uniswap (CRYPTO: UNI) was hit hardest and is now down 31% for the week.

The meme of a week
Dogecoin was the favorite meme cryptocurrency of the last cycle, and it was up in large part because meme coins have become popular again. Newer tokens dogwifhat (yes, that's the name) and Pepe have hit multibillion-dollar market caps with little utility other than trading and a meme.

Memes have always been part of the appeal of cryptocurrencies, but the past few months have seen launches on multiple blockchains that have brought more funds into the ecosystem and benefited many established users who were airdropped tokens.

The downside is that a market slide will hit meme coins harder than utility tokens.

Utility for the win
VeChain has gained traction on the hope it can become a low-cost, high-throughput blockchain as Solana struggles to perform under high transaction loads. The promise of Solana was that it could scale faster and more cost-effectively than older blockchains, but achieving those things has proved more difficult than expected.

Investors have been looking for the next hot blockchain for years, and VeChain could be it if users increase their adoption of it.

Uniswap's terrible week
This week, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) sent Uniswap Labs a Wells notice -- a notification that the regulator is planning a legal action against the group. This wasn't the first Wells notice in crypto, and companies have been fighting the SEC for years, but such actions are not good news for crypto holders.

It's not clear what Uniswap Labs will be charged with, nor what the outcome of the case will be, but if previous SEC actions are any indication, it's likely that a years-long legal battle is ahead for the decentralized finance platform developer. And that's not a distraction it needs.

Tailwinds may be fading
Over the past few months, crypto has had major tailwinds as Bitcoin ETFs were approved by the SEC and speculation about other crypto ETFs and lower interest rates ran rampant. But the past week has seen some of that optimism recede.

Higher-than-expected inflation is pushing market interest rates higher, and growth and tech stocks are moving lower as a result. The movements of the crypto market have correlated heavily with those of growth and tech stocks, which in part explains why some of the upward momentum for crypto is fading.

I think the SEC's case against Uniswap is more important than many observers may believe because it indicates the regulator will continue to go after companies in the space, despite its previous losses in crypto-related cases.

What the crypto and blockchain industry needs is regulatory clarity, and it's getting that in many countries around the world. But in the U.S., Congress and the SEC have been unable to come to decisions about what to do with crypto long term.

The good news is that big banks are moving forward with crypto development and blockchain tools, and that will force some clarity one way or another. But the crypto market will be volatile in the meantime.",Bitcoin

Watcher Guru, for instance, shows the halving will strike in seven days, seven hours and 20 minutes, while CoinMarketCap says it will happen two hours later. The “Bitcoin Block Reward Halving Countdown” says it’ll be in seven days and 15 hours. While these estimations are all generally aligned, for someone looking to trade on the halving may be a bit frustrated.

The Bitcoin halving is scheduled to occur every 210,000 blocks, or roughly every four years. This particular event will be executed automatically by the network at exactly blockheight 840,000. Based on the way Bitcoin’s creator Satoshi Nakamoto designed the system, bitcoin miners “find” the next block to hash to the blockchain every 10 minutes, meaning it should be easy to figure out precisely when the next halving should happen down to the minute.

In practice, however, things are a bit messier.

“Calculating the time to bitcoin halving has three important elements: The current block height, the block at which the next halving occurs and the average block time,” according to Simon Cousaert, director of data at The Block Research (which currently predicts the halving will fall in seven days, 15 hours and 40 minutes).

“Since the second element, the target block, is a constant, the accuracy of the countdown depends on the current block height and the average block time,” he said. Likewise for counting the current block height, which should be easy data to fetch.

Where the discrepancy likely comes in is how different halving calculators are counting the time between blocks. Again, theoretically the time to mine a block should be even 10 minutes, by design. But the amount of miners directing computational power to mine and secure the Bitcoin blockchain is not static, meaning that that figure can fluctuate.

“The average block time is harder to estimate accurately,” Cousaert said. “One can take a simple constant, and assume that every block takes 10 minutes to be mined.” But what halving calculators are likely doing is taking “the rolling average block time” over some time scale, whether it’s over the past 100, 90 or 30 days (or any other arbitrary period of time).

“This does not necessarily lead to a more accurate prediction, because the average of the last days does not necessarily predict the average for the next few days,” Cousaert added.

NiceHash lead mining manager Marko Tarman echoed this point saying that everyone in the world has the same access to some “static” data regarding Bitcoin: the halving block height. However, there are two other “dynamic pieces of information,” the current block height and block time.

“It's important to note that block times can fluctuate considerably,” Taman said. “If the average block times are shorter than 10 minutes, the predicted halving event will appear to be sooner. Conversely, if the average block times exceed 10 minutes, the halving event will seem to be delayed.”

In other words, counting down to the halving — an event not only known in advance, but actively anticipated to the point that people argue over whether it is “priced in” — is more of an art than a science.

“While this detail may not be critical when observing the countdown a year in advance, accuracy becomes increasingly important as the event approaches,” Tarman said.",Bitcoin
https://finance.yahoo.com/news/best-bitcoin-etfs-top-funds-163832792.html,Best Bitcoin ETFs: Top funds for buying Bitcoin,"Spot Bitcoin ETFs track the price of the crypto on effectively the same percentage basis, even if they trade at different prices. If Bitcoin rises one percent, then the fund should rise one percent. So you see that the funds have all risen approximately the same amount, with minor differences.

Which fund should you choose? If you were looking at two McDonald’s on the same block and they both offered Big Macs, it would make sense to go with the cheaper one. So it is with spot Bitcoin ETFs. Since these funds give you exposure to Bitcoin in the same way, their defining feature is their expense ratio, the percentage of your investment that they charge as a fee.

Some funds above are initially charging 0 percent fees for the first few months, as they pursue a “land grab” and look to grow their assets and users quickly. But those fees will eventually revert when their assets pass a certain threshold or the initial period of low fees expires.

A few funds may eventually become dominant and be able to lower their fees still more, and so draw in more investors, enabling them to lower prices even further and become more dominant.

The funds’ expense ratios are competitive with the fees for trading Bitcoin in all but the cheapest brokers and exchanges for cryptocurrency trading. So these Bitcoin funds can be a good option to keep your overall costs low while making it easy to trade from your existing online broker.",Bitcoin
https://finance.yahoo.com/news/security-engineer-jailed-3-years-163959996.html,Security engineer jailed for 3 years for $12M crypto hacks,"Shakeeb Ahmed, a cybersecurity engineer convicted of stealing around $12 million in crypto, was sentenced on Friday to three years in prison.

In a press release, the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York announced the sentence. Ahmed was accused of hacking into two cryptocurrency exchanges, and stealing around $12 million in crypto, according to prosecutors.

Adam Schwartz and Bradley Bondi, the lawyers representing Ahmed, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

When Ahmed was arrested last year, the authorities described him as “a senior security engineer for an international technology company.” His LinkedIn profile said he previously worked at Amazon. But he wasn’t working there at the time of his arrest, an Amazon spokesperson told TechCrunch.

While the name of one of his victims was never disclosed, Ahmed reportedly hacked into Crema Finance, a Solana-based crypto exchange, in early July 2022.

Then, weeks later, he hacked into Nirvana Finance. Ahmed stole $9 million and $3.6 million in those two hacks, respectively. In the case of Nirvana Finance, the stolen funds “represented approximately all the funds possessed by Nirvana,” which led Nirvana Finance to shut down, according to the press release.

Ahmed pleaded guilty to having carried out both cyberattacks.",Bitcoin
https://finance.yahoo.com/news/robert-kiyosaki-praises-cathie-woods-163435771.html,Robert Kiyosaki Praises Cathie Wood's Prediction That Bitcoin Will Hit $2.3 Million And Suggests 'Living Dangerously' And Buying More,"Both Robert Kiyosaki and Cathie Wood are well known in the finance and investing community, although for largely different reasons.

In the 1990s, Kiyosaki authored ""Rich Dad Poor Dad,"" a book about personal finance and building wealth. Wood is known for her role as CEO of Ark Invest, one of the largest asset management companies in the world. Despite their differing paths to fame, they agree on one thing: Bitcoin (BTC) is going to the moon.

Don't Miss:

If you invested $100 in DOGE when Elon Musk first tweeted about it in 2019, here’s how much you’d have today.

About 22% of the adult population in the U.S. own a share of Bitcoin, how much would $10 get you today?

In a post on X, Kiyosaki noted that Wood ""guarantees Bitcoin will hit $2.3 million per BTC. Do I believe her? Yes, I do. Cathie Wood is very smart. I trust her opinion.  Could she be wrong?  Yes. She could be.  So what? The more important question is ‘What do you believe?' What if Cathie is right?  What if Cathie is wrong?  And most importantly, ‘How many Bitcoin do you own?'  If Cathie is right I will wish I bought more.""

The ""Rich Dad"" is referencing a prediction that Wood made during a Bitcoin investor day in March. Wood argued that Bitcoin will reach between $1.5 million and $3.8 million by 2030. This prediction is largely based on institutional adoption, as Wood predicts that if institutional investors put 5% of their portfolios into Bitcoin, the price could go as high as $3.8 million.

Kiyosaki is likely getting the $2.3 million number from Wood's statement that ""if institutional investors were to allocate a little more than 5% of their portfolios to Bitcoin, as we think they will over time, that alone would add $2.3 million to the projection [of $1.5 million] I just gave you.”

In response to these ideas, Kiyosaki advised his followers to ""live dangerously"" and to buy ""$0.01 Bitcoin, regardless if Cathie is right or wrong you will be better educated, smarter, wiser when it comes to Bitcoin.""

He also sees a Bitcoin investment as a learning opportunity.

""In the real world, the richest and happiest people are people who make mistakes and learn from them their mistakes,"" he said.

Here, Kiyosaki believes that Bitcoin investors, no matter the amount, will ultimately come away from the experience with more knowledge, regardless of whether they made a profit from the investment.

Kiyosaki also believes that Bitoicn will appreciate, and ""will reach $2.3 million."" So, according to Kiyosaki, Bitcoin is ultimately a way to learn about digital currency and make a huge profit.",Bitcoin
https://finance.yahoo.com/news/memecoins-bad-investors-crypto-industry-161644429.html,Memecoins are bad for investors—and for the crypto industry,"Each new crypto bull cycle has brought prominent fads. In 2016, those included initial coin offerings, while in 2021 it was NFTs. This time around, it’s memecoins as a flood of new novelty tokens with names like Bonk and Dogwifhat find traction alongside the original memecoin, Doge, and its imitators like Shiba Inu and Pepe. The process has recently been supercharged thanks to an explosion of coins on the Solana blockchain and services like Pump.fun that makes it easy for nontechnical people to spin up and list tokens.

Here’s how DeFi news site The Defiant describes Pump.fun: “The launch process is as simple as clicking ‘Start a new coin’ and inputting a name, ticker, description, and imagery for branding, with a deployment cost of 0.02 SOL, or $3.50 at current prices. Prior to the token going live, the issuer has the option to purchase more of the token at the launch price, and after doing so, it is off to the races.”

This is yet another example of how, every cycle, crypto tools become more accessible to ordinary consumers. In most cases, I find myself cheering on the new development but, in the case of memecoins, I just can’t. Tools like Pump.fun reflect the worst aspects of the crypto industry—mindless speculation and greed that pretends to be something more.

Sure, I get the appeal of memecoins. They are a way to build new communities around a goofy idea like silly dogs or cranky frogs and can be a fun way to commemorate celebrities or events like the passing of Queen Elizabeth II. I’m also a believer that people should be left alone to do what they like with their money. If someone wants to go on a spree at a casino blackjack table or dump their savings into a timeshare in Haiti, well that’s ultimately their business. Likewise, if they want to invest in Floki or Grok instead of Bitcoin or bonds. As they say in Proverbs, don’t get between a fool and his folly.

And yet. The thing that bugs me about memecoins is they are not just harmless fun. While the boosters of many memecoins like to tout them as a joke that took on a life of their own—as was the case with Doge—the reality is they are no better than Ponzi schemes. Cynical hucksters work together to launch memecoins in the guise of creating a community or whatever but are really motivated by finding gullible people to fleece.

Unlike other blockchain projects that are trying to build a better computer network or new types of online governance, memecoins are proudly useless. And that’s fine until you think of the many young people who could be building wealth by buying Vanguard shares or I bonds—which let them share in the wealth of companies or governments—but are instead setting their scarce cash on fire purchasing digital dogs. Maybe I’m getting old, but I think we owe it to the next generation to teach financial literacy and steer them away from scams dressed up as investments.

And if appealing to the better instincts of the crypto industry doesn’t work (spoiler: it rarely does), then self-interest might do the trick. Lest anyone forget, the industry is facing the most ferocious regulatory crackdown in its history, and tokens like Bonk are only going to provide more fodder for agencies bent on repressing it. Stay away from memecoins.",Bitcoin
https://finance.yahoo.com/news/hacker-sentenced-3-years-prison-155320486.html,Hacker Sentenced to 3 Years in Prison for Stealing Over $12M From Crypto Exchanges,"Shakeeb Ahmed, a security engineer who stole over $12 million from two different decentralized cryptocurrency exchanges (DEXs) built on Solana, was sentenced to three years in prison and three years of supervised release by a federal judge on Friday.

Ahmed was arrested last year on wire fraud and money laundering charges, after federal officials alleged he stole $9 million from a DEX built on Solana – which appears to be Crema Finance. He pleaded guilty to one count of computer fraud in December.

He will also forfeit $12.3 million and pay $5 million in restitution as part of his sentence.

Prosecutors asked for a four-year sentence, noting that the statutory maximum was five years but Ahmed had accepted responsibility by pleading guilty and surrendering the proceeds of the hacks and therefore warranted ""a slightly below Guidelines variance,"" according to a sentencing memo filed last week.

Ahmed's defense team argued for no prison time, saying that in addition to his acceptance of responsibility, he had voluntarily disclosed his hack of Nirvana Finance to prosecutors.

""Shakeeb already had been indicted for the Crypto Exchange hack, and the government had offered Shakeeb a deal to plead guilty to that hack,"" the defense filing said. ""Although Shakeeb knew that disclosing another hack would result in additional consequences, and could take his favorable plea deal off of the table, Shakeeb voluntarily came forward anyway.""

In a statement, U.S. Attorney Damian Williams said Ahmed's guilty plea was ""the first ever conviction for the hack of a smart contract.""

""No matter how novel or sophisticated the hack, this Office and our law enforcement partners are committed to following the money and bringing hackers to justice. And as today’s sentence shows, time in prison – and forfeiture of all the stolen crypto – is the inevitable consequence of such destructive hacks,"" he said.",Bitcoin
https://finance.yahoo.com/news/halving-highlights-why-bitcoin-needs-151152802.html,The Halving Highlights Why Bitcoin Needs to Upgrade,"In mid-April of this year, Bitcoin will undergo its most recent halving event, meaning a 50% reduction in rewards for miners. Generally speaking, this event is seen as bullish for bitcoin, and the halvings of the past have all been followed by significant gains in the price of bitcoin. Of course, this comes at the immediate cost of revenue for those mining the asset.

Bob Bodily is the Provo, Utah-based CEO and Co-Founder of Bioniq, a BTC Ordinals marketplace. This op-ed is part of CoinDesk's ""Future of Bitcoin,"" package published to coincide with the Halving in April 2024.

This time may be different, though. The recent implementation of new protocols that offer enhanced functionality, as well as the billions of dollars of inflows to bitcoin ETFs, has changed the nature of the market and demand for this asset. Post halving, we may see activity on the network unlike ever before, driving up fees and helping to compensate for the reduced block rewards.

However, to capitalize on this, what is needed now is a change to Bitcoin on a fundamental level, one that can fix the very issues holding back broader adoption.

Into the Halving
The latest halving comes amid significant developments for the asset and protocol, most notably, the proliferation of Bitcoin Ordinals and BRC-20 tokens over the previous year. These assets are already understood as effectively being NFTs that work on top of Bitcoin, and they have unlocked new functionality for the ecosystem that was never possible before.

The popularity of these new digital goods could have a major impact on what happens to miner revenue in the wake of this halving. While this event itself is slashing returns for mining blocks, Ordinals and BRC-20s are driving up network fees, as they are relatively expensive to inscribe and trade.

What’s more, this halving will see the launch of a brand new type of asset on Bitcoin, Runes. Runes, developed by Casey Rodarmor, the inventor of Ordinals, enters the fray as a similar but new evolution of the idea of building assets on top of the existing blockchain and are designed to be a much more efficient way for users to issue fungible tokens on the network.

Despite their efficiency, Runes still represent yet another type of asset that will be in-demand in the post halving era, further driving up Bitcoin blockspace demand, network activity, and, subsequently, miner fees. Taken alongside the recent influx of funds from ETFs, this situation stands to offset, if not entirely replace, the income that previously was generated from mining rewards alone. The result could be that this halving may not affect miners the way previous ones did, possibly augmenting how the market ultimately responds.",Bitcoin
https://finance.yahoo.com/news/could-bitcoin-hit-another-time-133400448.html,Could Bitcoin Hit Another All-Time High in April?,"Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) has been on a remarkable run in 2024, defying expectations and once again capturing the attention of investors worldwide. With a staggering 55% surge in value since the beginning of the year and an impressive 320% increase since 2023, the world's most valuable cryptocurrency is showcasing its resilience and proving naysayers wrong yet again.

As April unfolds, a significant event looms on the horizon that could impact Bitcoin's trajectory, but it might not be enough to push it to a new all-time high this month. Here's why investors should be focused on the long term and not just what happens in April.

Analyzing the role of the halving
Slated to occur sometime around April 20, Bitcoin will undergo its fourth halving. Occurring roughly every four years, halvings underpin Bitcoin's robust monetary policy as it reduces its inflation rate by half.

This halving will cause the cryptocurrency's inflation rate to fall from 1.75% to roughly 0.8%. Over the long term, it's easy to see how the halvings can lead to serious impacts on Bitcoin's price. With a cut to its supply rate, the halvings make it so that even if demand remains constant, its price must increase to compensate for the diminished supply. However, on a shorter time frame, the halvings have historically produced minimal effects.

Historical returns during halving months have been minimal
Examining past halving events provides valuable insight into Bitcoin's price behavior during these periods. In May 2020, Bitcoin's most recent halving, the cryptocurrency experienced a modest 9.5% increase. In July 2016, Bitcoin actually fell 7%. Going back another four years, Bitcoin jumped only 12% in November 2012 at the time of its first halving.

These figures illustrate the variability of Bitcoin's performance during halving months, with an average return of approximately 4.6%. Applying this average to current prices, it suggests a potential price of around $72,700 by the end of April, falling shy of the record high achieved in mid-March when it notched an all-time high of more than $73,000.

Looking to the future
Despite the potential for short-term fluctuations, the overarching impact of Bitcoin's halving events underscores its long-term potential. During the entirety of years in which a halving occurs, Bitcoin returns an average of 125%. Even better, in the years following a halving, Bitcoin's price has jumped by more than 400% on average. Historically, it is in these post-halving years that Bitcoin typically notches a new all-time high.

By zooming out a bit, it's easy to see how a decrease to its inflation rate amplifies its scarcity and long-term value proposition. While the journey to another record-breaking price may not be immediate, the fundamental dynamics established by halving events position Bitcoin for continued success in the years to come.

It's worth noting that while historical data may offer guidance, it's essential to recognize that time and again Bitcoin has defied projections and surpassed expectations. Even though the average return during halving months may not indicate an imminent all-time high in April, Bitcoin's unpredictable nature means that anything is possible.

Rather than focusing on what this month may bring, investors are better off taking a step back, zooming out and analyzing Bitcoin over the course of years, not just a few weeks or months. As each halving compounds on the previous, increased adoption from retail and institutional investors should exert upward pressure on the world's premier cryptocurrency.",Bitcoin

About US$41 million in digital assets invested with the companies by more than 450 Australians has been handed to restructuring specialists.

The Australian Securities and Investment Commission alleges the companies broke the law and provided financial services without the appropriate license.

An Australian Federal Court agreed to a petition from the nation's market regulator to hand over approximately US$41 million in digital assets invested by over 450 Australians with the NGS group of blockchain mining companies to three specialists from McGrathNicol, an independent advisory and restructuring company.

The Australian Securities and Investment Commission (ASIC) said on Friday that it had commenced civil proceedings against NGS Crypto, NGS Digital and NGS Group and the sole directors of the companies: Brett Mendham, Ryan Brown and Mark Ten Caten, respectively. Mendham is also restrained from traveling outside of Australia.

The court order came after ASIC alleged the companies breached Australian law and provided financial services without an Australian financial services license.

""ASIC alleges that the NGS Companies target Australian investors to invest in blockchain mining packages with fixed-rate returns, encouraging them to use funds transferred from regulated super funds to self-managed super funds (SMSFs) and then converted into cryptocurrency,"" the regulator said.

The involvement of a restructuring company does not necessarily suggest the companies have collapsed. ASIC said it was concerned the funds were at risk of dissipation and appointing a receiver was the best way to protect the assets.

While it continues to investigate, ASIC has not sought an outright ban on the companies but only interim and final injunctions preventing them from operating without a license.

Native token Toncoin was largely unmoved immediately following the announcement.

The stewards of the TON ecosystem have formed a partnership with HashKey Group, the parent company of the Hong Kong-licensed crypto exchange of the same name.

One of the aims of the partnership is to increase provision for on- and off-ramping of crypto and fiat to Asia-Pacific users of the wallet service in messaging app Telegram.

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cryptocurrency-exchange-traded-fund-etf-093500172.html,"This Cryptocurrency Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) Could Soar 5,300%, According to Cathie Wood's Ark Invest","Ark Invest is an asset management company focused on disruptive innovation. Under CEO Cathie Wood, the company manages thematic exchange-traded funds (ETF) built around various technologies, including blockchain and cryptocurrency.

Ark has long been bullish on Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC). In 2015, it became the first public fund manager to gain exposure to the cryptocurrency, which traded around $200 at the time. Nearly a decade has passed, and Bitcoin is now worth $70,000, but Wood and her team still see substantial upside for investors.

The company published a Bitcoin valuation model in 2023 that posited a price of $1.5 million by 2030. That implies more than 2,000% upside from its current price. But Ark quietly revised its target higher after the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved spot Bitcoin ETFs in January 2024. Wood made that information public at the Bitcoin Investor Day conference last month, saying:

Last year, we put out our bull case for Bitcoin. It was $1.5 million. With this institutional green light that the SEC has provided, kicking and screaming though it did, the analysis we've done is that if institutional investors were to allocate a little more than 5% of their portfolios to Bitcoin, as we think they will over time, that alone would add $2.3 million to the projection I just gave you.

In short, Ark now believes Bitcoin could reach $3.8 million, presumably by 2030, though Wood didn't provide a specific time frame. The upside implied by the new target exceeds 5,300%. One way investors can capitalize on that is by purchasing a position in the iShares Bitcoin ETF (NASDAQ: IBIT), a recently approved spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund.

Why the iShares Bitcoin ETF is worth consideration
Until recently, getting direct Bitcoin exposure was a cumbersome and costly process for U.S. investors. They had to create and fund an account with a cryptocurrency exchange, where they usually had to pay exorbitant commissions on each transaction. For instance, Coinbase charges about 1.5% for simple trades. Additionally, investors who wanted complete control of their Bitcoin had to move the cryptocurrency to a specific type of blockchain wallet.

Fortunately, things got easier when the SEC approved spot Bitcoin ETFs in January. Those investment vehicles track the price of Bitcoin while eliminating the hassle of cryptocurrency exchanges, high fees, and specialized storage solutions. Ark highlighted those benefits in a recent report:

The launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs set the stage for Bitcoin's growth by offering investors a more direct, regulated, and liquid way to gain exposure. Bitcoin spot ETFs are traded on major stock exchanges, allowing investors to buy and sell shares through their existing brokerage accounts, and should reduce the learning curve and operational complexities associated with direct investments in Bitcoin.

The SEC has approved 11 spot Bitcoin ETFs, all of which do the same thing: track the price of Bitcoin. The only consequential differences lie in the expense ratios and the reputations of the issuers.

With that in mind, investors should consider the iShares Bitcoin ETF from BlackRock. It bears the third-lowest expense ratio of 0.25%, and BlackRock has a sterling reputation that comes with being the world's largest asset manager.

Investors shouldn't count on Bitcoin reaching $3.8 million
Ark Invest believes spot Bitcoin ETFs will eventually capture more than 5% of institutional assets under management (AUM). For context, consultancy PwC believes institutional AUM will reach $145 trillion by 2025. Using that figure, Ark's prediction implies that institutional investors will eventually allocate about $8 trillion to Bitcoin. That may be a stretch.

On one hand, the launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs has undoubtedly been a success. The ETFs issued by BlackRock and Fidelity saw more inflows during their first month on the market than any other ETFs in history, according to Eric Balchunas at Bloomberg. Additionally, the BlackRock ETF became the fastest ever to reach $10 billion in assets, according to The Wall Street Journal.

On the other hand, spot Bitcoin ETFs had collectively accumulated just $57 billion in assets as of April 4, according to The Block. Even if every penny came from institutional investors, which is certainly not true, that figure would need to increase 140-fold to reach $8 trillion. I doubt that will happen in the near future, so readers should not bank on Bitcoin reaching $3.8 million any time soon.

That said, the iShares Bitcoin ETF is still a worthwhile purchase for risk-tolerant investors. Bitcoin easily outperformed stocks, bonds, gold, commodities, and real estate over the last five years. Additionally, any investor who has bought and held Bitcoin for at least five years has profited, no matter when they made their purchase, according to Ark Invest. That makes for a compelling investment thesis.",Bitcoin

Most recently, Ark teamed up with 21Shares to launch a spot Bitcoin ETF—Ark 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB). The ETF has performed extremely well, attracting more than $3 billion in assets under management in less than three months.

With that success, Wood's opinion on Bitcoin has received lots of attention. She noted that Bitcoin could go as high as $3.8 million.

If you invested $100 in DOGE when Elon Musk first tweeted about it in 2019, here’s how much you’d have today.

About 22% of the adult population in the U.S. own a share of Bitcoin, how much would $10 get you today?

""With this institutional green light that the SEC [Security and Exchange Commission] has provided, kicking and screaming though it did, the analysis we've done is that if institutional investors were to allocate a little more than 5% of their portfolios to Bitcoin, as we think they will over time, that alone would add $2.3 million to the projection I just gave you,"" Wood said at a Bitcoin Investor Day in New York a few weeks ago.

Wood's previous prediction came in January when she stated that Bitcoin could go as high as $1.5 million by 2030, noting that ""the probability of the bull case has increased with this SEC approval. This is a green light.""

Wood's original projection was that Bitcoin would reach $1 million by 2030, which she gave before the approval of spot ETFs. The approval bumped the prediction up to $1.5 million, and the success of the ETFs bumped the prediction even higher to $3.8 million.

In addition to the success of the ETFs, Wood also sees the upcoming halving event as a potential further price catalyst. The halving, which occurs roughly every four years, is expected to happen around April 20. The event could lower the amount of Bitcoin minors sell each day, which could send the price even higher.

Wood's prediction for a $3.8 million BTC by 2030 also likely includes the next halving, which could occur in 2028. Looking at Bitcoin's price history, halvings typically precede higher highs, followed by higher lows. If Bitcoin continues this pattern into 2030, the price could peak around 2029 or 2030.

If Wood is correct and Bitcoin reaches $3.8 million, if you invested $1,000 in Bitcoin now, it would be worth $54,280 in 2030. This would result in a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of nearly 95%.

While the prediction is bullish, the 13-year CAGR on Bitcoin is well over 130%, so it is not entirely out of the question. However, as Wood stated, it would likely require huge amounts of institutional investment.",Bitcoin

Bitkub Capital signaled its intention to sell shares to the public in a 2023 letter to shareholders that didn't give a timeframe. Jirayut told Bloomberg earlier this month that an IPO was planned for next year and the company was in the process of hiring financial advisers.

Thailand's biggest crypto exchange provides about 80% of the Bangkok-based parent's profit and is 9.2% owned by Asphere Innovations. The firm was valued at about 6 billion baht ($165 million) in a Series A fundraising last July, Jirayut said.

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-much-tesla-made-bitcoin-204940588.html,Here's How Much Tesla Would Have Made on Bitcoin If It Had HODLed,"Tesla Inc., led by CEO Elon Musk, has continuously looked for new ways to innovate and use the latest technologies. This has manifested itself in many ways, ranging from autonomous driving to commercial solar panels. However, one less-discussed instance of Tesla using novel technology is with Bitcoin investments.

Musk is a known advocate for crypto, constantly posting on social media about cryptocurrency and accepting some forms of crypto as payment for Tesla merchandise. However, Musk put his money where his mouth was in 2021, making an investment in Bitcoin (BTC) that was unprecedented at the time.

Don't Miss:

If you invested $100 in DOGE when Elon Musk first tweeted about it in 2019, here’s how much you’d have today.

About 22% of the adult population in the U.S. own a share of Bitcoin, how much would $10 get you today?

In February 2021, Tesla spent $1.5 billion to purchase roughly 43,000 BTC at an average cost of around $38,000. Tesla used the extra cash to make the purchase and earn some return, citing low interest rates and high inflation.

After the investment was announced, Bitcoin's price quickly spiked to nearly $50,000, and Tesla's Bitcoin holdings were worth as much as $2.65 billion in mid-March 2021. By the end of March, BTC went as high as $60,000, prompting Tesla to sell some of its positions. Tesla sold 10% of the position, or 4,320 BTC, which allowed it to earn approximately $250 million in proceeds.

The company did not make any other moves with its Bitcoin holdings until June 2022. Between March 2021 and June 2022, the company held nearly 39,000 BTC, and the value of the position went as low as $875 million in June 2022.

At this time, Tesla sold a majority of its BTC. It sold 29,160 BTC for an average price of around $20,000. According to Musk, the sale served multiple purposes, such as proving that BTC can handle large transactions and giving Tesla extra cash in the event of a recession.

The sale came at one of the worst times possible. Bitcoin hit its lowest level in 18 months shortly after the sale but has since appreciated over 350% in the 16 months following.

In 2024, the price of Bitcoin has gone as high as $73,750. If Tesla had HODLed its original investment of 43,200 BTC, it would have been worth nearly $3.2 billion at the highs set in 2024. This is a gain of more than 100% or $1.55 billion. Instead, Tesla holds less than 10,000 BTC worth around $700 million.

By holding the tokens, Tesla would not have had to pay a capital gains tax on the first sale of Bitcoin in March 2021.

While Tesla may have made some poor trades with Bitcoin, the price has appreciated so much since then that the cumulative profit and loss on its BTC trades is nearing 0. If BTC keeps going up, Tesla could see green yet again.",Bitcoin
https://finance.yahoo.com/news/willem-schro-building-botanix-bitcoin-192719490.html,"Willem Schroé: Building Botanix, a Bitcoin Layer 2 That Brings the EVM to Bitcoin","When Willem Schroé was 17, he came in third out of 10,000 in a national math competition in Belgium, his home country. His prize was a book on botanics, the study of mathematics and fractals in nature. The book inspired awe in him, as he was humbled by the notion that physics and mathematics are bigger than any one of us. Today, he feels the same way about Bitcoin, which is why he’s building a groundbreaking Layer 2 on the network. But, before we get to that, let me offer you some background on Schroé.

Frank Corva is the Business-to-Business Correspondent at Bitcoin Magazine and host of the new renaissance capital podcast.

Schroé completed a bachelor’s and master’s degree in engineering at KU Leuven, the best university in Belgium and one of the best universities in the world. For his graduate degree, he focused on cryptography with a specialization in authenticated encryption and forward secrecy. He pursued his studies in the school’s world-renowned Computer Security and Industrial Security (COSIC) program, where legendary cryptographers David Chaum and Len Sassaman once lectured. Schroé’s thesis advisor was Vincent Rijmen, inventor of the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), which the U.S. government uses to protect classified data.

After graduating, Schroé couldn’t find a tech gig in Belgium, so he went into chemical engineering. He landed a job at a joint venture between ExxonMobil and SABIC in Saudi Arabia. On a business trip to Lebanon in 2019, he saw the ravaging effects of hyperinflation on the country. Deeply impacted by the experience, he decided to focus on building a better financial system on Bitcoin.

“I committed myself to spending all my resources, all my capabilities to make sure I helped Bitcoin succeed as soon as possible, because I could really see the world was moving faster and faster into a darker place,” says Schroé. “I see Bitcoin as being the light.”

Soon after, he applied and was accepted to Harvard Business School. While at Harvard, he continued to think about how to move Bitcoin forward but also took notice of the popularity of NFTs and the amount of trading volume on decentralized exchanges (DEX). He still believed in bitcoin as sound money but could not ignore the other technologies in the crypto space that were achieving product-market fit. This is when he conceptualized Botanix, a Bitcoin Layer 2 that employs bitcoin as money on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) via a novel design structure that Schroé calls “the spiderchain.” The name Botanix was inspired by the subject of the book he won at age 17 — a nod to the idea that Bitcoin, which is governed by mathematics, is bigger than all of us.

Fast-forward to late-2023 and the Botanix testnet is live.

I spoke with Schroé virtually while he was attending ETHDenver, in March, to learn about how he thinks Botanix will be received by both the Bitcoin and Ethereum communities, why proof-of-stake is a secure consensus mechanism for a Bitcoin Layer 2 and what challenges he’s faced in deploying the Botanix testnet.",Bitcoin

Danny Nelson
Fri, April 12, 2024 at 12:44 AM GMT+5:30
Crypto trader Avi Eisenberg may testify at his criminal commodities fraud and manipulation trial, his defense team said Thursday. They have yet to make a final decision on the matter as the government's case nears its conclusion.

The 28-year old crypto trader could face as much as a 20-year prison sentence if the 15-person jury convicts him on all three counts stemming from his October 2022 trades on the DeFi trading platform Mango Markets, which netted him at least $110 million in various cryptocurrencies. The government seeks to portray that trade as an illegal windfall from market manipulation, while the defense calls it a legitimate trading strategy.

Prosecutors are nearing the end of their week-long case against Eisenberg. On Thursday, they called a special agent and an expert witness that walked the jury through how Eisenberg allegedly drove up the price of MNGO tokens on AscendX, FTX and Serum in order to inflate the value of perpetual contracts he was trading on the Mango Markets decentralized exchange. Then, they said, he borrowed or withdrew well over $100 million from the exchange.

The government's case against Eisenberg hasn't yet arrived at the aftermath of that trade, when Mango Markets founder Dafydd Durairaj negotiated the return of $67 million to the platform and in exchange promised not to seek charges against him. Prosecutors on Thursday told the court they were no longer planning to call Durairaj to the stand.

That turnabout complicated the defense's plan to question him under oath even though they have not yet served Durairaj a subpoena. Lead defense attorney Sanford Talkin asked Judge Arum Subramanian if the court could force Durairaj's counsel Rafael Yakobi to accept a subpoena on his client's behalf.",Bitcoin
https://finance.yahoo.com/news/sec-suit-against-uniswap-opening-185929500.html,The SEC’s Suit Against Uniswap Is an Opening Attack Against DeFi,"Uniswap Labs, the Brooklyn-based outfit primarily responsible for developing the protocol of the same name, reportedly received a Wells Notice indicating the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission intends to sue. While the decentralized finance (DeFi) behemoth said it is “ready to fight” the SEC, indicating a willingness to go to court, the move does represent the latest front in the SEC’s yearslong battle with the crypto industry.

This is an excerpt from The Node newsletter, a daily roundup of the most pivotal crypto news on CoinDesk and beyond. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.

And to some extent, it is entirely predictable. Before this, the SEC has filed suit against U.S.-based exchanges Coinbase and Kraken. In fact, the reason the industry is so familiar with the term “Wells Notice” is because Coinbase received one in the months before the SEC’s lawsuit dropped. But the move is also a serious escalation in the SEC’s anti-crypto legal barrage.

“Taking into account the SEC’s ongoing lawsuits against Coinbase and others as well as their complete unwillingness to provide clarity or a path to registration to those operating lawfully within the US, we can only conclude that this is the latest political effort to target even the best actors building technology on blockchains,” Uniswap said on a blog announcing the Wells Notice.

The SEC’s biggest crypto cases so far have been after centralized institutions — the aforementioned centralized exchanges Coinbase and Kraken and the company behind the XRP cryptocurrency, Ripple. Suing the organization behind a decentralized protocol like Uniswap is uncharted territory.

Perhaps the closest example on the books would be the SEC’s case against LBRY, which built a decentralized alternative to YouTube that was forced to shut down after a lengthy appeals process with the U.S. securities watchdog. The SEC alleges LBRY sold unregistered securities via a utility token launch, and initially sought $22 million in fines but lowered that to $111,000 after acknowledging the company’s financial struggles.",Bitcoin
https://finance.yahoo.com/news/chaos-marginfi-shakes-solana-defis-180328341.html,Chaos at MarginFi Shakes up Solana DeFi's Borrow-and-Lend Landscape,"The biggest winner from MarginFi's leadership shakeup seems to be Solend, with $17 million in deposits in the last 24 hours and token rising 37%.

Kamino, another competitor, also saw $81 million in new deposits.

MarginFi is still Solana's second-largest borrow and lend service and fifth-largest DeFi protocol by TVL despite seeing a 31% deposit exodus in a single day.

Wednesday's leadership chaos at MarginFi sparked an exodus of $200 million in crypto capital from the borrow-and-lend service. Rather than staying on the sidelines, those coins are now flowing into competing platforms on the Solana blockchain.

The biggest winner appears to be Solend. In the past 24 hours, it has seen deposits worth $17 million, its largest single-day deposit jump since July 2022. Solend's deposits increased nearly 12% in a single day, and its token rallied 37% over the same period.

These spikes come after Solend's leader, the pseudonymous 0xRooter, offered a token airdrop to lenders who moved their money from MarginFi to his platform, one of the oldest borrow-and-lend outposts in Solana DeFi.

By sheer numbers, Kamino saw the largest jump of $81 million in new deposits, or 8.5% in a single day, per DeFi Llama. It doesn't have a token yet but is expected to airdrop one to its users later this month. Before the chaos began, Kamino had already jumped MarginFi to become Solana's largest borrow-and-lend platform.

Drift saw a modest increase of $3.38 million in deposits. It runs a combined platform that offers borrow-and-lend, yield-generating strategies and perpetual futures exchange services.

MarginFi remains Solana's second-largest borrow and lend service and fifth-largest DeFi protocol by TVL despite a 31% deposit exodus in a single day. The fiery resignation of its longtime CEO Edgar Pavlovsky leaves its immediate leadership structure and future uncertain, though its on-chain programs continue to run as designed.

MarginFi’s longtime leader, Edgar Pavlovsky, resigned Wednesday following an internal dispute at the protocol's builder, mrgn. After his departure, the remaining team at MRGN group appeared to have addressed an issue with the protocol's price data infrastructure that had caused issues for withdrawals for over a month.

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/vaneck-ceo-says-brokerage-platforms-174111210.html,VanEck CEO says brokerage platforms aren’t yet recommending Bitcoin ETFs: ‘There’s a long ways to go’,"The approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in January kicked off a frenzy as investors poured billions of dollars into the brand-new investment vehicles launched by financial mainstays like BlackRock and Fidelity. But even as the total trading volume of the asset class passed $200 billion, Jan van Eck, CEO of asset manager VanEck, one of the major issuers, said that Bitcoin ETFs are still in their infancy.

Speaking to Fortune on the sidelines of Paris Blockchain Week, van Eck said brokerage platforms aren’t yet allowing advisors to recommend Bitcoin ETFs, though there have been reports that firms such as Morgan Stanley are evaluating them. “Those are our biggest customer bases,” van Eck told Fortune. “So there’s a long ways to go.”

For now, the demand has mainly come from retail customers, although he expects that to change as platforms gain approval to start pushing Bitcoin ETFs. “Paper moves first in this world, and then decisions get made,” van Eck said, predicting that the shift could come this quarter.

‘Don’t get disrupted’
Founded by van Eck’s father in 1955, VanEck has long been at the forefront of alternative assets. John van Eck pivoted to gold investing as he worried about inflation, launching the first U.S. gold stock fund in 1968. “If you’re running a business, you’ve got to make sure that you don’t get disrupted,” his son told Fortune.

In 2017, VanEck became the first ETF issuer to file for a spot Bitcoin ETF, a few years after the Winklevoss-led Gemini applied for one in 2013. The Securities and Exchange Commission rejected potential issuers, with the approval process eventually moving forward after crypto firm Grayscale sued the agency to convert its Bitcoin trust into an ETF.

Now, with seven companies, including VanEck, applying for a spot Ethereum ETF, van Eck expressed skepticism that the agency would move forward with an approval. “Paperwork usually precedes action from a regulator,” he said. “And there’s no paperwork movements.”

He added that another lawsuit likely would be necessary to push the agency for approval, but there may be less appetite among stakeholders for another lengthy court battle.

‘People thought they were totally crazy’
With a crowded field of 12 Bitcoin ETFs, the question is whether the field will consolidate, with some issuers pulling out or acquiring competitors. VanEck is currently middle of the pack with around $600 million in assets under management, and BlackRock and Fidelity running away with the field.

Despite his firm’s slower start, van Eck said he’s been pleased with the progress. “We’d love to have $600 million in an ETF in its first three months,” he told Fortune. “The chances of that happening statistically in the ETF industry is probably 1%.” Still, he cautioned that because of the low management fees many of the issuers are charging, the vehicles won’t be profit drivers.

Another question is whether issuers will branch out to other custodians, after every firm, with the exception of VanEck, initially chose Coinbase. VanEck instead went with Gemini, which van Eck said was a “tip of the hat” to the firm being the first to apply for a Bitcoin ETF. “People thought they were totally crazy when they filed,” he told Fortune. He added that the firm would soon add a backup custodian.

VanEck is also expanding into other areas of crypto. In early April, van Eck’s son, Nick, announced the launch of his own digital asset firm, a stablecoin company called Agora. His father’s company would serve as the manager of its reserves, similar to how Cantor Fitzgerald holds U.S. Treasuries for Tether.

Despite Tether’s dominance in the stablecoin landscape, van Eck said there’s room for competition, especially with Tether’s wildcat status in the U.S. “A lot of firms are going through regulatory approval,” he told Fortune. “There’s plenty of room for exchanges to use other stables.”",Bitcoin

To Approve or Not to Approve? Point/Counterpoint Perspectives on the Upcoming Spot ETH ETF Decision
A notable theme in the ongoing bull market is Ethereum's (ETH) underperformance, which has deepened over the past few weeks due to increasing skepticism about the odds of the spot ETF decision being approved by the SEC on May 23.

The ETH/BTC price ratio just dipped below 0.05, marking its lowest point since Ethereum began gaining traction as an institutional-grade asset in May 2021.


As late as February of 2024, the market was anticipating a green light from the SEC on May 23 following the spot BTC ETF approvals in January 2024. This view has been turning sour over the past few weeks, to the point that the current prevailing view is a denial by the SEC. The discount to NAV on the closed-ended Ethereum trust ETHE, a proxy for the market-implied likelihood of denial, increased from 8% to over 25% in the past month.

Spot ETH ETFs will remain a topic of conversation for the markets as we approach May 23 and the next few quarters if they are not approved by then. Let’s explore what the main arguments for and against approval are.

Point (the Consensus View): The Case for Denial

Over the past few weeks, the market has been trending toward expecting the SEC not to approve a spot ETH ETF at the end of May. This line of argument hinges on a few points.

First, there has been virtually no engagement between the SEC and issuers less than two months from the deadline. This contrasts sharply with the spot BTC approval process, where a back-and-forth was publicly visible through a flurry of amendment filings in the months leading to the approval. Contrary to what some have argued, the recent public call for comments is standard and should not be construed as engagement from the regulator.

Another critical factor is the view that the SEC approved the spot BTC ETF approval only begrudgingly. The use cases that ETH currently enables, such as decentralized finance, may make the review process for the SEC more fraught with complexities.

One such nuance is the continued lack of confirmation by the SEC on whether ETH is or is not a security despite its sister agency CFTC claiming it is a commodity.

Counterpoint: The Case for Approval

Some investors and analysts are making persuasive arguments against the mainstream narrative of denial, even if they are not necessarily calling for a May approval.

As Grayscale’s chief legal officer suggested, the absence of engagement does not necessarily predict the outcome. Contrary to the BTC spot ETF approval process, there isn’t much to discuss now. Most of the back-and-forth between the BTC ETF issuers and the SEC was around the redemption mechanism (cash versus in-kind), which is already a settled issue.

The one area where there may be room for discussion would be whether the SEC would allow native staking of ETH. Despite the push by some issuers, the broad view is that staking is unlikely to be allowed initially. That’s a straightforward issue the SEC can resolve at a potential rule-change approval or later when it reviews the S1 (or S3) forms required before launch.

In addition, a denial would likely be met with litigation from the applicants, and there is strong evidence that the issuers would have a strong case. The spot BTC ETF approval hinged on the high correlation between the spot BTC and CME BTC futures markets According to analyses by Fidelity, Bitwise and Coinbase, the same level correlations also exist for ETH, making it an unlikely issue for the SEC to raise again.

Looking Ahead

The spot BTC ETF approval in January did not come by a wide margin. Two of the five SEC commissioners voted in favor, two against, and Chair Garry Gensler tipped the scale. Gensler’s may be the casting vote again for the spot ETH ETF decision.

Out of the over 575 ETFs BlackRock has filed as an issuer, only one was denied by the SEC. Will the spot ETH ETF be the second? The market is attributing relatively high odds of denial, but if there’s one thing crypto investors have learned over the years, it's that last-minute surprises should never be ruled out.

Going beyond this approval cycle ending on May 23, it seems only a matter of “when” and not “if” for spot ETH ETFs to launch in the U.S. market. The arguments for approval will likely outweigh the ones for denial over time. As a result, even if approval does not come by May 23, the chances of a greenlight over the next 12-18 months seem high.",Bitcoin

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bitcoin-road-100k-5-catalysts-132700155.html,Bitcoin & The Road to $100k (5 Catalysts),"Bitcoin is having another classic year of outperformance versus other asset classes. However, the bull market is far from over. Below are five catalysts that will drive the world’s largest cryptocurrency past $100k, including:

Widespread Institutional Adoption

Institutional adoption, the moment Bitcoin enthusiasts have waited for, is here. The Bitcoin ETF launch, which occurred earlier this year, was the most successful in history. ETFs such as the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) have attracted billions in inflows and have gained more than 70% since debuting. That said, the ETF debut has not only helped ETF operators and Bitcoin itself, but it has also led to massive earnings in the exchange custodian for these ETFs, Coinbase (COIN). Meanwhile, MicroStrategy (MSTR) has soared nearly 1,000% (not a typo) in five years after adopting the “Bitcoin standard.” Finally, El Salvador is benefitting from purchasing millions in Bitcoin, Fidelity (one of the world’s largest asset managers) owns Bitcoin, and a European Bitcoin ETF is likely to be launched soon. Bitcoin adoption is here and is insatiable. The only question left to ask is, “Who will be next?”

Bitcoin Halving = Supply Constraint

While demand is likely to soar, supply will be constrained in 2024 due to the next “Bitcoin Halving” in April. A Bitcoin halving is an event that occurs approximately every four years, reducing the reward miners receive for validating and adding new blocks to the Bitcoin blockchain by half. One of the virtues of Bitcoin is its built-in “anti-inflationary” monetary policy. The reduction in the rate at which new Bitcoins are created leads to a gradual decrease in the overall supply of newly minted Bitcoins. Though the number of halvings in Bitcoin’s history is only three, and history is no guarantor, the stats suggest that bulls should stay the course for at least the next year. Bitcoin has delivered at least triple-digit one year after the halving, including +7,715% in 2012/13, +283% in 2016/17, and +423% in 2020/21!

Election Year Seasonality

Equity investors often leverage historical seasonality trends to gain in edge in the market. Like with equities, investors can look to history to identify historical trends. For Bitcoin, the presidential election years (like the one we are in now) have been incredibly bullish. In the past three election years, Bitcoin returns were as follows: 2012 +272.4%, 2016 +161.1%, and 2020 +302.8%.

Long-Term Breakout to New High

Investors often overcomplicate technical analysis, utilizing fancy indicators and ultimately suffering from “paralysis by analysis.” However, with Bitcoin, simplicity has paid dividends and has allowed investors to block out the day-to-day volatility and noise. Bitcoin is breaking out to fresh all-time highs for the first time in years. Each time these multi-year breakouts have occurred, Bitcoin has produced meteoric returns.",Bitcoin

The sign, which Langalis drew on a lined yellow legal pad with a fine-point pen (a Uniball Vision, he told CoinDesk), will be listed Thursday on Scarce City, an online marketplace that sells physical and digital collectibles (and, naturally, accepts payment only in bitcoin).

In an interview with CoinDesk, Langalis said he would use the proceeds to fund his company, Tirrel Corp. The pre-seed-stage startup is building an implementation and wallet for Bitcoin's layer-2 Lightning network on top of Urbit, an open-source software project that attempts to rewrite the entire internet computing stack from first principles.

Asked how much he expected the memento – scribbled at a time when bitcoin {{BTC}} traded around $2,400 – to fetch, Langalis said, ""I try not to think about it."" However, he said that in recent weeks he received a private offer to buy the sign for five BTC, roughly $350,000 at recent prices. There is no reserve bid, or minimum price, he said.

Bidding for the sign will commence on April 18 and run for a week on Scarce City, but final bids will be entertained in person on April 24 at PubKey, a bitcoin-themed dive bar in New York (where a replica of the sign hangs on the wall). ""It's a way to celebrate with the community,"" Langalis said.

The agency said in a filing Monday that it was extending the period for deciding on a New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) proposal ""to permit the listing and trading of options"" on the Bitwise Bitcoin ETF (BITB), the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), ""and any trust that holds bitcoin.""

""The Commission finds it appropriate to designate a longer period within which to take action on the proposed rule change,"" the SEC said in the filing.

The NYSE first filed for the rule change on Feb. 9, which was listed on the Federal Register, triggering a 45-day comment period that was due to expire April 14. The Federal Register is the federal government's daily journal of rules, proposed rules, notices and executive orders.

Investors use options to enter a contract where they can buy or sell a stock or an exchange traded fund at a specific price over a period. Investors often use options to bet on a stock, to hedge their risk, or for income.

Demand for cryptocurrency investment products has soared this year, following the SEC's approval of 10 spot bitcoin ETFs on Jan. 10. These funds have accrued roughly $60 billion in assets under management since they began trading a day later, helping to spur a nearly 60% year-to-date price gain. Bitcoin, the world's largest asset in market value, was trading above $70,500 late Wednesday (ET).

A number of firms are eager to roll out products that would allow investors to hedge their bets on the cryptocurrency.

The SEC’s next deadline to decide on the rule change is May 29.

Bitcoin Futures Options
The agency has allowed options trading on bitcoin futures ETFs since 2021.

Grayscale CEO Michael Sonnenshein submitted a public comment on Feb. 28, urging the SEC to approve the NYSE’s rule change. “Our argument is straightforward: if investing in options for shares of products holding derivatives of an asset is acceptable for investors, investing in options for shares of products holding the asset itself should be as well,” he said.

The Cboe exchange has also filed a proposal that would allow options trading on spot bitcoin funds. The SEC has an April 24 deadline to rule on the exchange's filing. Cboe said in a filing that while it usually allows options to trade three days after approval, “rules do not apply to ETPs holding commodities.”",Bitcoin

Bitcoin-based meme coins, NFTs, and Ordinals could form part of a “barbell strategy” comprised of both technical and non-serious projects, some traders say.

Bitcoin’s {{BTC}} much anticipated halving event later this month could see a flurry of bets on related networks and ecosystem tokens, with traders expecting upside on both technical and meme coin projects.

Halving reduces the rate at which new coins are created and lowers the available new supply. The current block reward is 6.25 BTC, and it will drop to 3.125 BTC after the halving. This event has historically preceded a bull market for the token.

Crypto traders say participants seek a “reason to buy” as money narratives continuously shift in the current bullish environment and they may turn their focus on the bitcoin ecosystem in the coming weeks.

“There exists a large, untapped pool of capital within the Bitcoin ecosystem that remains dormant, and surprisingly few listed assets that traders can use to gain exposure to the narrative,” the OTC desk of trading firm Wintermute told CoinDesk over email.

“Should capital begin to rotate into the Bitcoin ecosystem, tokens like $RUNE, $STX, and $ORDI could benefit significantly and outperform,” they added.

THORChain’s RUNE and Stack’s STX have been among the top-performing tokens in the past year, CoinGecko data shows, tracking a bitcoin rise. Meme coin ordi (ORDI) – a nod to the Ordinals protocol on Bitcoin – has surged over 2,500% since its September issuance.

Meanwhile, Bartosz Lipinski is the founder of the crypto trading platform Cube.Exchange said in an email that meme coins and the upcoming Runes protocol could rile up risky bets in the bitcoin ecosystem.

“Ethereum’s high costs and significant network congestion will cause it to take a backseat as Bitcoin-based projects, like Rune, will redirect meme coin hype to the Bitcoin ecosystem because of the novelty,” Lipinski said. “The BRC-20 (Ordinals NFT) standard is likely to be overtaken by Runes, which is expected to launch on the day of the halving.”

“Runes will aim to replace the standard with fungible tokens, which will enable the efficient creation of meme coins to compete with projects on Base and Solana,” he added, referring to the ongoing frenzy for non-serious tokens in the two ecosystems.

Ordinals are a way to embed data into the Bitcoin blockchain by inscribing references to digital art into small Bitcoin-based transactions.

Ordinal volumes were higher than those of usual leaders Ethereum and Solana in the past week, as reported, led by NodeMonkes and Pups. Non-fungible token (NFT) on other networks buying and selling activity declined 95% across all networks in the same period, suggestive of an isolated interest in Ordinals.",Bitcoin

Only 10% expect the token to extend past $75,000, a bank survey found.

Consumers are split on the future of bitcoin, with 38% predicting that it will ""disappear"" in a few years.

While crypto bulls are celebrating bitcoin's 2024 surge as the first leg of a blowout rally to come, not all consumers are as optimistic about the token's prospects this year.

According to a Deutsche Bank survey conducted in March, nearly one-third of global consumers expect the apex coin to plunge below $20,000 by the end of 2024.

That would represent a plummet of over 70% from bitcoin's current valuation, which stood at $68,652 as of 12 p.m. ET on Wednesday.

In stark contrast, some of the asset's most outspoken proponents have argued that it will punch past the $100,000 threshold in the same timeframe.

For instance, it's a view long put out by Standard Chartered analyst Geoff Kendrick, who also anticipates the coin to reach as high as $200,000 next year. Bernstein strategists have also ratcheted up their outlook, expecting a $150,000 valuation by 2025.

It's an optimism that's chiefly sprung out from this year's approval of spot bitcoin ETFs, considered as a major amplifier for crypto demand. Already, these funds have helped propel the currency 63% year-to-date.

Meanwhile, this month's anticipated halving event will lower bitcoin output, putting upside pressure on its price.

Rising adoption is why crypto billionaire Mike Novogratz expects $50,000 to be bitcoin's newest price floor, a level it's unlikely to revisit, he said in March.

But according to the survey, only 10% of consumers see the token reaching past $75,000 this year. That would be just over the $73,000 peak bitcoin reached in last month, before paring gains.

The dip echoed through multiple asset classes, but bitcoin gradually erased all its losses, and was up over 1% over the past 24 hours, outperforming U.S. equities and gold, both of which finished with sizable declines for the day. At press time, bitcoin had slipped a bit from the $70,000 level, trading at $69,800.

Shiba Inu: How Much You'd Have If You Invested $10,000 At The Start Of The Year","A ton of tokens have made headlines in 2024, with some of the most discussed being Bitcoin (BTC), Solana (SOL) and Shiba Inu (SHIB).

These tokens cover a wide range of use cases and purposes and have performed well to start the year. Take a look at how an investment in each would have fared in 2024.

For Bitcoin, some of the primary drivers in 2024 are the release of spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in January and the market pricing for the upcoming halving. The ETFs brought in tons of new buyers and have been the most successful ETF launch in history. The halving is projected to decrease the amount of tokens sold each day, potentially leading to higher prices.

Don't Miss:

If you invested $100 in DOGE when Elon Musk first tweeted about it in 2019, here’s how much you’d have today.

About 22% of the adult population in the U.S. own a share of Bitcoin, how much would $10 get you today?

If you invested $10,000 in Bitcoin on Jan. 1, your investment would be worth $17,400. This is based on a low BTC price of $41,700 to start 2024 and a high of $72,700 in mid-April.

Solana also has seen large gains in 2024. The project had a rough 2023 after the collapse of FTX Trading Ltd. However, the project has experienced a strong comeback in 2024, largely because of a host of new meme coins on the chain that have increased demand for SOL. Some of the tokens include Bonk (BONK) and dogwifhat (WIF). These meme coins have caused so much demand on the Solana chain that the network has struggled to keep up, experiencing congestion issues in April.

A $10,000 investment in SOL at the beginning of the year would be worth $24,400. SOL began the year trading as low as $86 and has gone as high as $210. However, the price has since dropped and is now trading around $180.

Finally, Shiba Inu has been one of the largest meme coins in 2024. The project has expanded its use cases beyond memes and a form of payment, now offering staking and governance as well as a decentralized exchange and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). These new use cases may have helped the token attract new users and sent the price higher. Additionally, the overall meme coin mania has helped the token perform well, as it is the second-largest meme coin behind Dogecoin (DOGE) and has been around for some time.

If you had invested $10,000 in SHIB at the beginning of the year, your position could have been worth as much as $34,200. This is based on SHIB beginning the year trading for around $0.0000105 and going as high as $0.000036. The price of SHIB is currently trading lower at around 0.000025.

These gains have outpaced every major index, potentially showing the opportunities for large profits that are associated with crypto. For reference, in the same period, a $10,000 investment in the S&P 500 would currently be worth $10,883. So, with lots of time left in 2024, it will be interesting to see how crypto performs relative to other asset classes.",Bitcoin

Investing in real estate just got a whole lot simpler. This Jeff Bezos-backed startup will allow you to become a landlord in just 10 minutes, and you only need $100.

Grant Cardone, author of the recently released book ""The Wealth Creation Formula,"" has said that homeownership is a trap because you are physically stuck in the same place — often for as long as 30 years — and that renting is a better choice because it provides flexibility.

""You have to live in the same place every day for 30 years and pay for it,"" Cardone told GoBankingRates in October. ""It is a terrible, terrible investment. What about if, in a year three years, you have this great opportunity to move to another part of the country or part of the world to have a better job — you couldn't because you have 27 years left on your loan. It would be smarter to pay $2,000 a month in rent for the next 30 years.""

Cardone also said that buying a home as an investment isn't much better, noting that the return on investment is lower than other assets such as the S&P 500 or bonds — after making a down payment on a house, that money no longer grows.

""The money is dead,"" Cardone said. ""Your down payment's lost. [Plus], you have to service the debt every month.""

And when you try to sell the house to recoup your investment — and hopefully a profit — you'll have to make 70% on the sale to pay the interest pay a 6% real estate brokerage commission and property insurance, which is 2% in Florida, he said.

""So you have to make almost 100% in 10 years for you to break even — and you lost your mobility,"" Cardone said.

Cardone says people should stop thinking about home ownership as part of the American dream — especially if they have to take out a 30-year mortgage to pay for it.

""The house, for most people, is a nightmare — not a dream,"" he said. ""At the very least, it's a trap.""",Bitcoin

The protocol, which is almost profitable, is designed to give depositors exposure to high-yield rate arbitrage trades, for which it charges a 10% or higher fee.

The company building Stream Finance, one of the Ethereum blockchain's newest crypto derivatives platforms, has raised $1.5 million from Polychain and a handful of angel investors.

Stream Trading raised its seed round at a $20 million valuation, founder Diogenes Casares said in an interview with CoinDesk. He and co-founder Solal Afota built the team quickly to capitalize on this year's crypto bull market, which is paying fat dividends for trading platforms across decentralized finance (DeFi).

Derivatives exchanges are a fixture of the on-chain landscape for speculating on token prices, with platforms such as dYdX and Vertex getting much of the attention and hundreds of millions of dollars in crypto deposits. In comparison, Stream, which emerged from beta testing just this week, has $5 million in total value locked.

Still, that's already enough to nearly turn Stream profitable, Casares said. The protocol is designed to give depositors exposure to high-yield rate arbitrage trades, for which it charges a 10% or higher fee.

Over time Casares said Stream plans to become a decentralized perpetuals exchange that competes with dYdX and the other ""legacy"" names in DeFi derivatives, an industry barely five years old. He said most protocols focus too much on cutting fees while doing little to improve funding rates – the interest traders pay when speculating on the future price of assets.",Bitcoin

ETH's bitcoin-bearing performance could be attributed to continued market interest in decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol Ethena, which has seen its total value locked (TVL) cross the $2.2 billion mark over the last few days after crossing $2 billion on April 6.

Ethena's USDe synthetic stablecoin recently added bitcoin as collateral, CoinDesk reported.

This may be purely a rally based on token demand rather than the hope of an ether spot exchange-traded fund being approved in the near future.

As such, ETH's market-beating rise has brought rapid adjustment in market positioning, leading to a sharp uptick in the perpetual funding rates or cost of holding long/short positions, Singapore-based QCP capital explained in a note on Telegram. The upside volatility has also led to a significant short covering in ETH front-end call options.

Developers behind the project also released plans for measures to cut fees.

Starknet is the biggest in a category of layer-2 networks known as ZK rollups.

The developers behind Starknet, the Ethereum layer-2 network whose $2.3 billion STRK token airdrop last month captivated crypto markets, plan to add a design feature known as ""parallelization"" – one of the factors that reportedly makes rival blockchain Solana popular as a venue for fast, cheap transactions.


The feature will go live as part of an upgrade set for the second quarter, allowing Starknet to ""process a greater number of transactions simultaneously, resulting in improved throughput and faster L2 finality,"" according to a press release distributed by a representative of the developer StarkWare. It is part of the 2024 road map released Wednesday.

""Parallel execution is basically multitasking for rollups,"" Eli Ben-Sasson, CEO of StarkWare and a board member of Starknet Foundation, said in a statement forwarded by a press representative via Telegram. ""This will address a bottleneck, and keep transactions flowing faster and more efficiently. It's like a subway station with one entrance point tackling congestion by opening more entrances.""

Specifically, he said, Starknet's sequencer will be getting the parallel execution. A sequencer is a component of a layer-2 network that bundles up transactions conducted on the network and relays them to the main Ethereum network to be settled.

According to the website L2Beat, which ranks layer-2 networks, Starknet is the sixth-biggest, with a total value locked (TVL) of $1.4 billion, well behind the leaders Arbitrum One and OP Mainnet.

Among the class of layer 2s known as ""ZK Rollups,"" designed for faster settlements based on a technology known as zero-knowledge cryptography, Starknet is the biggest.

The meme coin frenzy seems to have catalyzed higher volumes on Solana.

Solana also boasts of higher capital efficiency than Ethereum and other chains, according to one research firm.

Solana has replaced Ethereum as the No. 1 smart-contract blockchain by trading volume.


Trading volume in Solana-based decentralized exchanges (DEX) has increased 67% to $21.3 billion in seven days, data tracked by DeFiLlama show. Volume in Ethereum-based decentralized exchanges rose 3% to $19.4 billion over the same period. There are 17 DEXes on Solana. Orca, the largest, accounts for 88% of the total volume. On Ethereum, Uniswap leads the pack of 46 DEXes.

The so-called flippening seems to have been catalyzed by speculative fervor in Solana-based meme coins dogwifwhat, bonk, book of meme, and slerf.

At press time, the top trending tokens for the past 24 hours on the DEX Screener were from Solana. Such has been the speculative frenzy that 2,300 meme coins came into existence in a single hour on March 13 and the supply of stablecoins on Solana hit a multiyear high of $2.80 billion.


According to Reflexivity Research, the surge in Solana's volume began in fourth-quarter 2023 as a result of the proliferation of points programs and airdrops like the Solana DEX Jupiter.

Solana also boasts a higher capital efficiency than Ethereum and other smart-contract blockchains. In other words, the blockchain can support higher trading volumes with a lower dollar value of assets locked in its DeFi ecosystem.

""The DEX volume-to-total value locked (TVL) ratio, has recently highlighted Solana's notable performance over Ethereum.

SLERF came into existence following a token presale, during which it raised $10 million from users. It quickly went viral on social platform X after its developer said they accidentally sent all the money raised to a burn address, a crypto wallet address that’s not controlled by anyone, thus losing access to the funds.

That did nothing to stop a frenzied market from purchasing and trading the tokens. SLERF was eventually floated on Solana-based exchanges including Jupiter and Orca and the price surged to as high as $1.4 within a few hours from an initial value near 3 cents.

Some professional traders have termed SLERF a “blue-chip meme” – a nod to blue-chip stocks – for reasons ranging from its fair distribution among holders to perceived future demand. A blue-chip stock is a sign of stability and quality at the corporate level and usually relates to a company that has a long history.

Liquid restaking involves staking ether, which helps secure Ethereum, in return for a yield and often also loyalty points that can eventually be converted into a token airdrop. In return for the staked ether, restaking protocols like Ether.Fi distribute a liquid restaking token, in this case eETH, which is pegged to ether's price. The token can be used on other decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols to earn additional yield.

Some developers have referred to the release as a cheap for crypto because of its implications for how users interact with decentralized apps on Ethereum’s secondary scaling platforms (layer 2s).

This is an excerpt from The Node newsletter, a daily roundup of the most pivotal crypto news on CoinDesk and beyond. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.

In short, Dencun will change how data is stored on Ethereum, making it significantly more accessible and also cheaper to record layer 2 transactions. There’s already been a lot written about Dencun (a portmanteau of two separate updates, Cancun and Deneb, accounting for nine separate Ethereum Improvement Proposals) and there’s a lot to say.


Latest News: Ethereum Finalizes 'Dencun' Upgrade, in Landmark Move to Reduce Data Fees

But the massive upgrade has been in the works for a while, meaning there’s potentially a lot of lesser known details about how it came to be. Here’s what you need to know about how Dencun will affect you, and how it came about:

Ethereum’s Gas-less Era: Dencun will make L2 transactions super cheap — nearly costless, to the point that almost all activity on Ethereum will switch to these networks. There may even be projects or protocols that will incentivize use by eating the gas payments users usually have to bear (it’d be cheaper than paying for marketing!).

Major Milestone: Dencun is the biggest Ethereum upgrade since The Merge in September of 2022, which transitioned the network from a purposefully inefficient proof-of-work algorithm to staking. It is also one of the steps towards Ethereum’s ultimate goal of being able to support hundreds of different rollups and secondary scaling layers, and one day to process millions of transactions per second.

Long in the Works: Dencun will introduce the process of Proto-Danksharding, something long theorized (it was first mentioned by Buterin in 2019) which changes how Ethereum stores data. Instead of keeping all data directly on the Ethereum mainnet’s immutable execution layer, which is expensive and computationally heavy, Dencun will introduce a new, temporary way of storing “blobs” of data, which is cheaper. Blobs may sound like a silly term, but they’re actually a common concept in computer science. There are similar data management blobs in programming languages like Javascript and Python.",Ethereum (ETH)
https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ethereum-blockchain-counts-down-dencun-151114619.html,"Ethereum Blockchain Counts Down to 'Dencun' Upgrade, Set to Reduce Fees","Ethereum developers are preparing for Wednesday's much anticipated Dencun upgrade, set to bring the biggest code change to the blockchain in over a year.

Dencun – a portmanteau for the project names Deneb + Cancun – consists of two upgrades happening simultaneously on Ethereum’s consensus and execution layers

Technically known as a ""hard fork"" in blockchain terminology, it's expected to initiate around 13:55 UTC (9:55 a.m. ET). The upgrade is designed to usher in a new era of cheaper fees for the growing array of auxiliary networks that operate on top of Ethereum, called layer-2 (L2) ""rollups."" Those changes will come with the activation of a new Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) called “proto-danksharding,” or EIP-4844, which is designed to improve the chain's ability to handle data from L2 networks.


Elements of the Dencun upgrade have been planned for several years, but developers delayed it from an original target of late 2023 due to some engineering concerns. Since then, developers have tested the package on three separate test networks (testnets), and most of those tests ran smoothly. (The first test on Goerli did not finalize for a few hours, but once a bug was patched, things began running smoothly again.)

Some Ethereum fans are marking the occasion of Dencun's official launch by joining watch parties, with the EthStaker developer community and Nethermind, a leading Ethereum infrastructure team, each hosting livestreams.

“We are making sure all our client and bootnodes are fully updated, and ready for fork,” said Barnabas Busa, a DevOps engineer at the Ethereum Foundation. “Our monitoring infrastructure is scaled up to ensure we don’t miss anything important.”

What is Dencun?
Dencun will be Ethereum's biggest update since April 2023's Shapella upgrade, which enabled withdrawals of staked ether (ETH).

Dencun includes a number of code changes, but the biggest one comes with “proto-danksharding,” which introduces a new method for storing transaction data onto Ethereum, called ""blobs.""

Layer-2 networks like Arbitrum, Optimism and Polygon will benefit the most from Dencun. The networks help to scale Ethereum by bundling up transactions from users and then passing them to Ethereum where they're settled in big batches. Over the past year, they've become the primary venues for transacting on top of Ethereum, amassing billions of dollars in deposits and consistently boasting higher transaction volumes than the main Ethereum chain.

After Dencun, L2s will be able to post data to Ethereum within the dedicated blobspace, rather than be forced to pay a higher cost for squeezing the data into conventional transactions. In theory, this could help L2s settle more data, more efficiently – thereby reducing fees for end-users.

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/where-did-wrong-ethereum-scaling-213228156.html,Where Did We Go Wrong With Ethereum Scaling?,"Coming off the heels of ETH Denver, the rollup ecosystem is buzzing over the several new and exciting ideas discussed in the Mile High City to address the growing state fragmentation issue in the rollup space.

Avi Zurlo is the chief product officer of =nil; Foundation.

At the event, leaders, builders and visionaries revisited Ethereum’s rollup-centric roadmap from 2020; where we’ve come as an industry since then; and how the new roadmap has led to an explosive growth for the L2 ecosystem. Indeed, the total value locked in layer 2s is up by over 230% in the past year alone.


With this growth came the natural next step in evolution: modular scaling designs. While modular blockchains (i.e. networks that specialize in performing specific functions) are serving near-term demand for cheaper transactions and providing entirely new application designs, thought leaders in Denver unanimously agreed that there are still outstanding challenges presented by modular scaling. These issues are particularly apparent when new rollups are introduced to the Ethereum ecosystem, which compound the problems of splitting up functionality.

Each rollup exists within a siloed environment

Addressing the current technical issues of Ethereum’s rollup architecture, Ethereum Foundation developer Justin Drake said it best: We have a fragmentation problem.

Where did we go wrong with modular scaling?
In a perfect world, Ethereum scaling solutions would maintain Universal Synchronous composability enabling a seamless exchange and real-time settlement of transactions on the network. In reality, however, each rollup exists within a siloed environment that has neither notion of other rollups state nor Ethereum.

See also: Ethereum's Vitalik Buterin Writes on 'Enshrinement' of L2 Functions on Mainnet

This state fragmentation fundamentally compromises the principle network effects of the Ethereum ecosystem, introduces compounding complexity (and risk) of interoperability protocols and results in an objectively worsened developer and user experience. Making matters worse, price-sensitive applications are forced to run app-specific infrastructure to avoid congestion fees on general-purpose rollups, exacerbating the state fragmentation problem further.

So how did we get here?

Compromised network effects
Compromising on the principle network effects of global state (i.e. the idea that Ethereum is the ""world computer"") is perhaps one of the more obvious reasons why modular blockchains fail to deliver on their promise of being the holy grail of scaling solutions.

The frenzy is benefitting investors who hold ether {{ETH}}, the network's native token, because of its token burning scheme. After Ethereum's transition to a proof-of-stake blockchain – commonly referred to as the Merge –, the network destroys a part of the transaction fees paid by users, decreasing the token's supply.

Over the past week, ETH's supply shrunk by some 33,400 tokens (worth roughly $130 million at current prices), and is deflationary at a 1.45% annualized rate, according to Ultrasound.money data.

On the other hand, the heightened activity has made the blockchain very pricey for users. Average transaction costs (gas fees) on Ethereum rose to as high as $28 this week, making it ""unusable"" for many users, IntoTheBlock noted.

Fees on layer 2s, designed to scale the Ethereum network, also surged, with transactions costing as much as $1 on Arbitrum, the highest since 2022, the report said. This issue has a quick fix though with the Dencun upgrade coming up next week, which is expected to lower transaction costs on layer 2s to cents.

Ether briefly topped $4,000 on Friday for the first time since late 2021, but tumbled over 4% along with bitcoin {{BTC}}. Recently, ETH changed hands at around $3,900, up 15% this week, in line with the broad-market CoinDesk 20 Index's (CD20) advance.",Ethereum (ETH)

The cryptocurrency had been climbing over the past few months alongside bitcoin, which reached record highs March 5. The last time ether was this high was Dec. 28, 2021.

Ether has outperformed bitcoin over the past 30 days, climbing 67%, while bitcoin rallied 57% and the CoinDesk 20 Index, a gauge of the broader crypto market, added 53%.

Ether has been rising on speculation of a spot ether exchange-traded fund (ETF) approval in the U.S. A regulatory decision is expected in May. Spot bitcoin ETFs were approved in January and have witnessed billions in net inflows.

The odds for approval of a spot ETF are not as clear for a spot bitcoin ETFs, according to Bitwise analysts. The analysts gave a 50%-60% chance of approval, saying it will happen ""sooner or later.""

The Ethereum blockchain's Dencun upgrade, scheduled for March 13, has also buoyed the token. The upgrade is expected to result in lower fees for users of layer-2 networks.

The upcoming Dencun upgrade and excitement around spot ETF applications are key catalysts.

Ether {{ETH}} has been ""largely overshadowed"" by bitcoin {{BTC}} for the past several months, but the laggard could more than double in price in 2024, according to Juan Leon, crypto research analyst at asset manager Bitwise.


""[Ether] could very well go above $8,000, $10,000 this year, maybe even higher,"" said Leon in an interview with CoinDesk Markets Daily.

""Bitcoin has sucked up all the attention with the bitcoin ETFs launching, but [ETH] has at least two major catalysts that will come into focus,"" Leon noted.

This month's Dencun upgrade will make transactions cheaper on layer 2 networks, which will bolster activity and even attract mainstream, mass consumer demand for the Ethereum, he explained.

""Most of the positive sentiment will happen weeks and months after the upgrade as the effects take place,"" he added.

Another catalyst are the spot ether exchange-traded fund (ETF) applications, with a regulatory decision deadline approaching in May.

The odds for an approval are not as clear as were in the case for the spot bitcoin ETFs earlier this year, the Bitwise analyst said, but the possibility will bring excitement to ether. He gave a 50%-60% chance for an approval, but said it will happen ""sooner or later.""

A potential approval would boost ether's appeal among more conservative, institutional investors, just as the new spot bitcoin ETFs launched in January attracted strong investor demand, amassing nearly $9 billion net inflows.

Ether's deflationary supply, the restaking boom led by EigenLayer, and increasing decentralized finance (DeFi) activity also support higher prices for ETH, broker firm Bernstein said in a report last month.

When ETH can break all-time highs
While BTC already notched a new all-time high this week, ether has been lagging, still some 20% lower than its 2021 all-time high.

This is similar to how the previous market cycle unfolded, with bitcoin – being the oldest and largest market cap cryptocurrency – leading the market recovery from the bottom, with ether and smaller cryptocurrencies lagging.

Late November 2020, BTC was knocking at its all-time highs at $19,000 in, while ETH was hovering below $600, some 60% lower than its 2018 peak. A few weeks later, when BTC decisively broke above its former record price, ETH embarked on a multi-month rally to eventually hit a $4,400 peak in May.

It is expected to result in lower fees for users of layer-2 networks.

It allows Ethereum to act as a proper database for other blockchains.

The Ethereum blockchain's Dencun upgrade, scheduled for March 13, is the first step toward enabling its rollup–centric roadmap and will allow the network to function as a proper database for layer-2 blockchains to store data more efficiently and cheaply, Fidelity Digital Assets said in a research report on Wednesday.


""Ethereum's improvement as a database unveils the opportunity for near-zero transaction fees for users of layer 2's,"" and this could attract more users, wrote analyst Max Wadington.

The upgrade will provide the scaling needed to support millions of users on layer-2 blockchains, making it a more ""fitting distributed database for other blockchains,"" the report said. The improvements are expected to bring substantially more users into the Ethereum ecosystem and should expand the network's total addressable market (TAM).

The upgrade will lower costs for layer 2 blockchains to store data on the main blockchain, and this reduction will probably be passed along to users in the form of lower fees.

Rollups are Ethereum protocols that process transactions separately from the main network to help increase speed and lower costs. Layer 2s are separate blockchains built on top of layer 1s, or the base layer, that reduce bottlenecks with scaling and data.

Still, the upgrade will not have many direct positive effects for Ethereum users because the fee reductions promised to layer 2 users will not affect those transacting on the base Ethereum blockchain, the note said.

""In the short term, users who wish to benefit from this fee change must sacrifice some decentralization and security by transacting on layer 2's instead of Ethereum,"" Wadington wrote. ""This will certainly spur more users to bridge assets elsewhere.""

The entire market capitalization of the crypto sector peaked right around $3 trillion during the height of the last hype-driven mania in 2021. However, a so-called ‘crypto winter’ ensued in the last couple years, with the sector bottoming out around $900 billion. At the time of writing, the entire market is moving quickly toward a $2.5 trillion valuation, with plenty of momentum to break through to new highs.


Ethereum (ETH-USD) is certainly one of the top tokens leading the way higher, alongside the king of crypto Bitcoin (BTC-USD). Yet, there could be other more lucrative options in this sector for long-term investors seeking even greater upside. Let’s dive into three such tokens.

Solana (SOL-USD)

A well-known “Ethereum Killer,” Solana (SOL-USD) might be an excellent option to consider instead of Ethereum.

This proof-of-stake network is built on an intriguing proof-of-history consensus mechanism. Essentially, that means Solana uses time stamps to speed up the sorting of transactions. Doing so allows the network to process multiples of the typical order flow at a fraction of the cost.

Therefore, this speed and cost advantage are reasons most investors like Solana. The network has become synonymous with the NFT space, given the fact that many transactions are for smaller dollar amounts. Ethereum’s network, which can charge hefty gas fees for its usage, isn’t as well-suited for such purposes. Hence, the real-world utility Solana has been able to generate.

Additionally, while Ethereum focuses more on gradual upgrades, Solana is known for innovative solutions such as their Saga phone and successful crypto strategies. These high-growth strategies make this token more compelling for those seeking outsized gains, at least during this bull market rally.

Avalanche (AVAX-USD)

It was only in 2020 when Ava Labs launched Avalanche (AVAX-USD). This new blockchain offers seamless automated contract executions through its smart contract support. Also, Avalanche focuses on enhancing scalability and usability. This allows the blockchain to handle thousands of transactions per second.

One of the best features investors love about Avalanche compared to Ethereum is its relative cost-effectiveness. Like Solana, Avalanche offers transaction fees that are a fraction of the cost, which is rare for other blockchains to offer.

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/expect-ethereum-cancun-deneb-upgrade-181000712.html,What to Expect From Ethereum’s Cancun-Deneb Upgrade,"The Ethereum blockchain has seen significant upgrades in recent times, enhancing its scalability, efficiency, and security. These improvements address the blockchain trilemma — the challenge of balancing security, decentralization and scalability. These ongoing enhancements are crucial for improving network performance while keeping costs low.

The upcoming Ethereum Cancun-Deneb (“Dencun”) hard fork upgrade is set to be deployed on the mainnet on March 13. This upgrade will prioritize scalability, efficiency and security through various Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs), notably EIP-4844 for proto-danksharding. This proposal aims to optimize gas fees and enhance network scalability.


You're reading Crypto Long & Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.

The Dencun upgrade marks the beginning of ""The Surge"" era in Ethereum's roadmap, paving the way for achieving mass scalability through layer-two rollups. These rollups will make Ethereum more accessible and user-friendly, driving adoption and utility across various sectors, including DeFi 2.0.

The Benefits of Layer-2 Rollups

Layer-2 rollups enhance Ethereum's scalability and efficiency by processing transactions off-chain while preserving the security assurances of the main Ethereum blockchain (Layer-1). They have the following characteristics:

Off-Chain execution: Processing transactions off-chain enables quicker and more cost-effective throughput without competing for space on the Ethereum blockchain.

Transaction aggregation: Results of multiple transactions are aggregated or bundled into a single compressed form of transaction data after off-chain execution.

Posting to main chain: The compressed transaction data, or rollup, is then posted to the Ethereum main chain (Layer-1).

Data availability: Despite off-chain processing, the main Ethereum blockchain ensures that transaction-related data remains accessible and verifiable by all participants.

Security: Layer-2 rollups maintain the security guarantees of the Ethereum network through various cryptographic techniques.

Significance of EIP-4844 for Proto-Danksharding

EIP-4844, or Proto-Danksharding, aims to significantly enhance the network's scalability by introducing temporary data blobs attached to blocks. This innovation reduces processing costs and increases throughput by:

Temporary data blobs: These storage spaces attached to Ethereum blocks allow additional data to be included in transactions without directly interacting with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).

Lower processing costs: Efficient handling of transaction data via blobs leads to lower gas fees for users, potentially driving average transaction costs below $0.01.

Increased throughput: EIP-4844 enables higher transaction throughput, potentially reaching speeds of up to 100,000 transactions per second (TPS).

Facilitating Layer-2 solutions: The proposal is expected to benefit Layer 2 scaling solutions, such as rollups, by providing additional temporary storage space.

The company also raised $4 million in a previously unannounced round last year.

Ether.fi now has $1.66 billion in total value locked.

Liquid restaking protocol ether.fi has raised $23 million in a Series A round led by Bullish Capital and CoinFund.

The round also included investment from OKX Ventures, Foresight Ventures, Consensys and Amber, among others. CoinDesk is owned by the Bullish Group.


The raise comes off the back of a rapid growth period for the restaking protocol, with the total amount of value locked (TVL) on the protocol rising to $1.66 billion from $103 million, DefiLlama data shows.

The company also raised $4 million in a previously unannounced simple agreement for future equity (SAFE) round that closed toward the end of last year, it said in a tweet.

“Ether.fi has seen remarkable growth, and we are thrilled to welcome the backing of leading crypto investors to support our continued expansion,” said Mike Silagadze, CEO and co-founder of ether.fi.

Restaking is a strategy used to earn an additional yield on ether {{ETH}} that is already “staked” on the main Ethereum blockchain. Currently, ether stakers can generate an annual yield of 3.85%.

The restaking protocol allows those staking ether to restake on EigenLayer in return for eETH, a liquid token that can be used across the decentralized finance (DeFi) market.

The total amount of capital locked across restaking protocols has risen to more than $10 billion over the past two months. This rise can be attributed to the bullish sentiment among investors who are looking to receive rewards whilst retaining exposure to the Ethereum ecosystem. Rewards come in the form of yield of loyalty points, which are tipped to eventually convertible to token airdrops.

“As investors pivot towards Ethereum’s DeFi ecosystem post-bitcoin ETF launch, ether.fi takes the lead as the only protocol to allow redemptions and not just speculative one-way deposits, showcasing our reliability and dedication to empowering users,” Silagadze added.

“Our journey is not just about chasing the bull market; it’s about sculpting the future of decentralized finance one staking reward at a time. We are revolutionizing restaking, transforming illiquid assets into opportunities. By leading the market with native restaking rewards, we aim to fuel the Eigenlayer ecosystem’s exponential growth.""",Ethereum (ETH)

The development suggests continued outperformance of alternative cryptocurrencies ahead.

Crypto bulls questioning the sustainability of recent sharp gains in alternative cryptocurrencies (altcoins), including meme coins, may consider the latest trend in the spread between bitcoin and ether perpetual funding rates.


Data tracked by Glassnode show that the spread recently collapsed to an annualized level of - 9%, a sign investors are willing to pay more to take leveraged long or bullish bets in the ether perpetual futures market compared to bitcoin {{BTC}}. In other words, risk appetite is rising – investors are willing to pour money into smaller and risky altcoins, expecting to generate a large profit.

“The spread between BTC and ETH funding rates is widening. Prior to October-2023, a relatively neutral regime can be observed, where the spread oscillated between positive and negative state,” Glassnode said in the weekly newsletter.

""However, since the October rally, funding rates for ETH have been consistently higher than for BTC, inferring an increased appetite by traders to speculate further out on the risk curve,” Glassnode added.

Bitcoin is the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market value and the most liquid, with growing mainstream adoption. Ether, meanwhile, is considered a relatively high beta and an altcoin leader. Thus, the price or funding rate differential in bitcoin and ether markets reflects the broader risk sentiment as the AUD/JPY pair does in traditional markets.

Perpetuals or futures without expiry include a funding rate mechanism so that prices for perpetuals closely follow spot prices. A positive funding rate means leverage is skewed to the bullish side, and long position holders are willing to pay shorts to keep their bets open. A negative rate suggests otherwise.

The bitcoin-ether funding rate spread hovered between -3% (lower bound) and +3% (upper bound) in the first nine months of 2023. Since October, the spread has seen several brief drops below -3%, signaling a bias for ether and the wider altcoin market.

JOSH LIPTON: Broader markets seeing muted action in today's trade, but the big move is in crypto. Let's get it over to Jared Blikre for more. Jared.

JARED BLIKRE: That's right, Josh. We got some milestones in the rearview mirror. It seems like only hours ago I was talking about Bitcoin, 52,000. Now it's Bitcoin, 54,500. And Ethereum really stealing the show today-- it's only up 2% over the last 24 hours, but it has finally cleared 3,000. And it was kind of flirting with that number last week. Now it has decisively moved above it.

And now what's in sight here? We got the record highs basically for Bitcoin and Ethereum. For Bitcoin, we're looking probably at 60,000-- that's going to be one of the biggest resistance levels-- and in Ethereum, probably in the low 4,000s here. The remains, quite a bit of price memory, but we've seen Bitcoin and Ethereum slice through these previous highs before in prior cycles.

And what do I mean by cycle? Well, we're coming up against another halvening in Bitcoin that has always been a bullish catalyst that just kind of brings to the forefront the time when, I guess, the imagination that there is a limited supply, total finite supply of Bitcoin. And the miners, they drop out in these halvenings. So that's going to come in a couple of months.

But with respect to Ethereum, let me just stick on that for a second because there is a key upgrade coming March 12th, March 13th called ""Dencun,"" D-E-N-C-U-N. And this is going to upgrade the speed of the network, basically going to make it more compatible with some of the upstarts like Solana.

And let me just show you a Solana chart that has really exploded to the upside today. Here's a five-year look. But over the last three months, largely trading sideways. But we do have a range expansion today-- doesn't mean a whole lot until we clear 125. But given the length of the consolidation here, I would expect that punch above to have some momentum with it.

And then just thinking overall about Bitcoin, the behemoth here, I mentioned 60,000 as a price target level. Actually, the highs are about just shy of 70,000. But I would say 60,000 is probably the last stand here. And we are rapidly approaching that point. You got to imagine, what are the potential negative catalysts? I don't see a lot.

There could be another sell the news event with something, but we got Binance kind of behind us. We're still waiting for the sentencing for CZ. But a lot of those crypto obstacles that mired cryptocurrency in that crypto winter, most of those have disappeared. And so it seems like bright skies ahead for the crypto land.

SEANA SMITH: Let's take a look at Ethereum. We have certainly seen a rally play out now well above a $3,000, crossing above that $3,100 level. Jared Blikre has a closer look at this rally that we've seen, and exactly, I guess, why we're seeing this rally, and what this could mean here for what's ahead, Jared.

JARED BLIKRE: Yeah. Sometimes it's difficult to tease out the catalyst and the true meaning and origins behind these moves. But one of the reasons-- so two things happening actually. There is a spot Ethereum ETF. There's lots of hype around that. Very similar to the spot Bitcoin ETF.

But there's also an upgrade scheduled for March 12. It then can upgrade. That's supposed to make it more quick, more compatible, actually more faster with respect to Solana. I guess that's the word I was looking for.

I do find it interesting that over the last three days, Ethereum has been up 4.1% while Solana competitor is down about 7/10 of a percent. So I think, Seana, that actually gives some weight to that potential argument that this is, in fact, about the upgrade.

But let's take a look at the price action. This is over the last three days. We actually punched above $3,000 a few days ago over the weekend. And let me just show you a five-year view. So we can see those record highs right around $5,000.

Now, as it happens, a lot of times, when we don't have a lot of price history, we've just gone straight up, sometimes it pauses at these big psychological levels. $3,000 was a level. $3,500 is a level right here. $4,000 is a level. So we'll have to watch these, as we keep heading higher here. But it looks like there's a lot of fuel in the tank for crypto.

We have the Bitcoin halvening. That's Bitcoin, not Ethereum, but there's-- it does create a lot of excitement around Bitcoin and crypto, in general, when we have these halvenings. And that's going to happen in April.

Every time that's happened before, that has kicked off a crypto supercycle. So we could be in store for that as well. And since I mentioned Solana, even though it's a laggard over the last few days, here's a look at Solana over the last five years. This was an even more parabolic chart that we saw a couple of years ago in its rise.

But I'm checking out this consolidation here. And let me put a three-month chart on. This is a pretty tight formation. And I got to think with price coming off of these lows very quickly, and then taking a few months to regroup, that only makes it more likely that whenever we launch beyond this point, that this will be used as a support base.

So for instance, if we were able to launch up here, come back down, these levels right in here around $100, $105 should theoretically act as support. Guys?

SEANA SMITH: All right. Jared, thanks so much for breaking that down. Certainly, seems like, at least, for now, the crypto bull market getting just a bit wider.",Ethereum (ETH)
https://finance.yahoo.com/news/avail-ethereum-data-network-rival-134500126.html,"Avail, an Ethereum Data Network to Rival Celestia, Raises $27M In Seed Round","Avail, among a handful of new ""data availability"" blockchain projects designed to handle transaction data produced by the increasingly sprawling networks, announced on Monday a $27 million fundraising led by the venture capital firms Founders Fund and Dragonfly.

Avail, spun out of Polygon in March 2023 and is led by a Polygon co-founder, Anurag Arjun, will use funds from the seed round to develop three of core products: its data availability solution (DA), Nexus and Fusion, collectively marketed as the “Trinity.”


Avail DA,the first core component, offers data space data for auxiliary ""layer-2 networks"" or ""rollups"" designed to handle transactions faster and cheaper than on base blockchains like Ethereum. The new DA project is expected to go live early in the second quarter of 2024.

The emergence of these data availability solutions has become one of the most hotly discussed trends in crypto, since they could help to turn blockchain systems architecture into a more ""modular"" design, where core functions like transaction execution and data processing could be handled separately.

They came into the limelight last year with projects like Celestia, which went live in October, and EigenDA, currently in development. The latter project is being developed by EigenLabs, the firm behind the restaking protocol EigenLayer, which last week raised $100 million from the venture capital firm a16z to keep building out its products.

Avail Nexus is a “zero-knowledge, proof-based coordination rollup on Avail DA,” meaning that it will operate as an infrastructure layer that connects different rollups through the Avail ecosystem to talk to one another, according to a press release seen by CoinDesk. It will “act as the verification hub, which unifies a wide array of rollups both inside and outside the Avail ecosystem, utilizing Avail DA as the root of trust.”

The project's “Fusion Security” will take crypto assets like bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) and contribute to the security of the Avail ecosystem.

Nexus’ first iteration is expected to go live during 2024, while Fusion Security will be ready in 2025, according to the company.

The rollups space on Ethereum is fragmented, with major teams competing for many of the same users.

Arjun, the Avail co-founder, argues that there is a need to work together with these rollups in order to make the user experience more unified.

“You really need a credible third party like Avail to come and work with all these teams,” Arjun told CoinDesk in an interview. “We essentially want to be that unifying factor in that sense, and we have built out a technology so that it can enable these kinds of changes.”",Ethereum (ETH)

Bitcoin hovered around the $51,500 mark in Asian morning hours Monday, while ether regained the $3,100 level. XRP, Cardano’s ADA and Avalanche’s AVAX were down 1% in the past 24 hours, while BNB Chain’s BNB was up 1.2%.

A similar pattern played out in the bitcoin market in November, accelerating price gains above $36,000.

Dealer hedging, a market dynamic that accelerated bitcoin's {{BTC}} uptrend in late 2023, is now influencing ether's {{ETH}} price.


Ether, the native token of Ethereum’s blockchain, peeped above $3,000 early Thursday. The breakout above the psychological barrier was partly aided by the hedging activities of market makers or dealers from the ether options market, according to Griffin Ardern, head of options trading and research at crypto financial platform BloFin.

Per Ardern, dealers or entities tasked with providing liquidity to order books recently sold many calls or bullish bets at $3,000, leaving them with a so-called negative gamma exposure. So, as ether rallied close to the said level, dealers bought ether in the spot/futures market to hedge upside risks and keep their overall market exposure direction neutral. The hedging activity added to the bullish momentum, lifting ether past $3,000.

A similar pattern played out in the bitcoin market in November, accelerating price gains above $36,000.

Market makers are entities tasked with providing liquidity to the order book. They are always on the opposite side of clients' trades and constantly buy and sell the underlying asset to maintain an overall market-neutral book.

""A large amount of negative dealers' gamma is concentrated around $3,000, so market makers need to hedge the risk here. Negative gamma means that the market maker sold many calls at the $3k strike,"" Ardern told CoinDesk. ""To deal with this, market makers must trade in the direction of the price move – buy ether as prices rise.""

""The hedging program took effect at around 6:48 a.m. UTC early today,"" Ardern added.

Ether topped $3,000 at around 08:55 UTC, rising to a high of $3032 by 09:50 UTC, data from charting platform TradingView show.

Back in mid-2023, market makers in both BTC and ETH options markets held a positive gamma exposure and constantly traded against the price direction, thereby arresting price volatility.

The second-largest cryptocurrency's gains are being fueled by hopes that it could be next to get ETF approval.

Ether is currently trading at $2,899.97, after briefly breaching the $3,000 level on Tuesday.

The crypto ETF hype has found a new home: ether.

Ether has surged 27% so far this year, surpassing bitcoin's gains of 20%. The second-biggest cryptocurrency's gains are being partially fueled by hopes that ether could be next in line after the approval of the spot bitcoin ETF. It marks a reversal from 2023, when bitcoin led the pack.

Ether is currently trading at $2,282.32, after briefly breaching the $3,000 level on Tuesday. Meanwhile, bitcoin is trading at $50,921.01. Its market cap recently surpassed $1 trillion for the first time in over two years, as the approval of ETF boosted demand and as a halving event — which will reduce supply — approaches in April this year.

The spot bitcoin ETF, which tracks the real-time price of the token unlike previous ETFs which wagered future prices, was approved in January this year. Since the SEC approval, inflows into the 10 funds have notched $5.2 billion.

And the excitement has bled into ether. Even in the derivatives space, open interest in CME Group's ether futures marketplace is close to hitting a record high.

The total crypto market is now worth $2 trillion for the first time since April 2022.

Ether ETF applications have already been filed by the likes of VanEck and Ark 21Shares, and according to Standard Chartered, an approval could arrive in May, Bloomberg previously reported. Bernstein analysts have also placed a 50% odds that the ETF could be approved.

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/2-overbought-cryptos-sell-2-101500884.html,2 Overbought Cryptos to Sell and 2 to Buy ASAP,"Determining the cryptocurrencies to buy and sell is notoriously irrational at times. Hype and speculation often fuel short-term gains rather than real-world utility. As a result, investors can get caught up chasing meme coins or obscure altcoins in hopes of quick profits. However, not all cryptos are created equal when it comes to long-term viability.

It’s wise to take profits on overextended coins that are unlikely to reach new highs in the next cycle. These could be meme coins that have had their time of fame or obscure alts that lack developer talent or real adoption. Meanwhile, more promising utility cryptos with strong fundamentals may still have substantial upside, even from today’s prices.


Shifting funds from overbought cryptos into more sustainable projects could pay major dividends over the long run. The projects with real utility are far more likely to stand the test of time and deliver steady growth year after year.

A concept image of cryptocurrency with three coins.
Dogwifhat (WIF-USD) has undoubtedly been the breakout meme coin of this cycle so far. As a newer meme token built on the fast-growing Solana (SOL-USD) blockchain, it has absolutely exploded in popularity in recent months. At the time of writing, WIF has a staggering market capitalization of $3.5 billion, making it one of the largest meme coins on the market. There’s no denying it has delivered tremendous returns in a short timeframe.

However, dogwifhat may be getting a bit overheated at current levels. Solana’s low fees have enabled speculation in WIF and other Solana-based altcoins, but hype-driven gains can be difficult to sustain long-term. While further near-term rises are certainly possible if the meme coin craze continues, WIF lacks the real-world utility and fundamentals that typically enable cryptos to reach new highs cycle after cycle. Once the spotlight fades, WIF could struggle to remain relevant.

For those reasons, investors should consider taking some profits on WIF here before momentum stalls. Meme mania won’t last forever, and more sustainable crypto projects may soon take center stage again. WIF has likely peaked for this cycle, so the time to sell may be approaching faster than many realize.

Banano (BAN-USD) actually boasts some intriguing real-world use cases to back up the hype. As a fork of the instant, feeless DAG-based crypto Nano, Banano leverages a similar architecture that enables free, near-instant transactions. This gives it an inherent utility as a payment coin that many speculative meme tokens lack.

But Banano’s most exciting use case is its ability to leverage user-contributed computing power for medical research. By allocating their GPU resources to Banano’s Folding@Home initiative, users can contribute processing power to disease research and earn BAN tokens as an incentive. This provides a sustainable source of demand for the coin as the need for distributed computing power grows.

With Banano’s market cap still at just $11 million despite an avid fan base, I believe the coin remains undervalued relative to its potential. If Banano continues gaining support and expands to additional exchanges, the price could explode. I’m bullish on BAN’s capacity for substantial further growth this market cycle if Redditors and research organizations utilize its network more heavily moving forward.

Internet Computer (ICP)

Internet Computer (ICP-USD) looked poised to disrupt the crypto industry with its unique approach to on-chain computing and decentralization. However, ICP tokens have cratered from all-time highs.

Some renewed speculative interest has boosted ICP in recent weeks as altcoins have rallied. But make no mistake — this temporary bounce should not be viewed as a convincing recovery. I believe now is the time to abandon ship entirely on this controversial crypto before losses mount further.

A key long-term headwind that should concern investors is Internet Computer’s astronomical token inflation schedule. An overwhelming amount of ICP will enter circulation in the coming years, massively diluting the value of current holders’ stakes. With little ecosystem adoption and activity to show for such extreme dilution, ICP appears fundamentally flawed.

Sure, Internet Computer still operates in red-hot emerging sectors like DeFi, NFTs, and the metaverse. However, with better-positioned alternatives available, there is no reason to weather the perpetual inflation storm that ICP has in store. The window to sell may shut quickly if ICP rolls over, so investors should strongly consider rotating funds into other cryptos with superior tokenomics and real-world traction.

Bitcoin halving means the reward for mining bitcoin is cut in half. Halvings reduce the rate at which new coins are created and therefore lower the available amount of new supply. Bitcoin (BTC-USD) last halved on May 11, 2020, resulting in a block reward of 6.25 BTC. The next halving will bring the block reward down to 3.125 BTC.


Frantic trading in the lead up to the event has driven up the price of bitcoin, with volatility over the past 24 hours causing the digital asset to fall to $65,000 (£51,340), before subsequently recovering to currently trade slightly above $66,000 (£52,130).

Although the forthcoming bitcoin halving is expected to decrease the supply of bitcoin, potentially resulting in price appreciation, recent market trends indicate that investors may be cashing in on profits ahead of the event. This was evidenced by a significant drop in bitcoin's price at the beginning of the week, plummeting from nearly $70,000 (£55,290) to slightly above the $65,000 threshold.

Ether has under-performed bitcoin in the past week, falling by 7% compared to bitcoin's 6% decrease. Ether is facing challenges stemming from uncertainty surrounding the potential approval of a spot ETF by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) before a May deadline.

Another major altcoin, Solana (SOL-USD), has also drifted downwards, falling by a more muted 1% in the past week.

The bitcoin halving event
The halving event is expected to take place mid-April. This will reduce the rate at which new bitcoins are produced and ultimately limiting the total supply of bitcoin, which may potentially increase its scarcity and influence its value.

This will be bitcoin's fourth halving, and according to Coinbase (COIN), it will happen sometime between 16 April and 22 April.

The halving mechanism operates by reducing the rate at which new bitcoins enter circulation. During the halving, the block reward of the bitcoin network will decrease from 6.25 bitcoin to 3.125 bitcoin.

Bitcoin has a capped supply of 21 million tokens. To date, approximately 19 million tokens have been released and according to CoinGecko, the present bitcoin circulating supply is 19,672,875 BTC.

Following the last halving on 11 May, 2020, bitcoin's price surged by approximately 12% in the subsequent week. Later in the year, bitcoin experienced a sharp rally, with various explanations offered, including loose monetary policy and retail investors spending excess cash on cryptocurrencies while staying at home.

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-lesser-known-altcoins-buy-203000612.html,3 Lesser-Known Altcoins to Buy Amid Bitcoin’s Bounce Back,"Bitcoin (BTC-USD) is the king of cryptocurrency. It is so dominant that all other cryptocurrencies are known as altcoins. That strongly suggests that Bitcoin is the number one choice and that all others are alternatives.

It’s hard to argue with that assertion, given how strong a force Bitcoin is in determining the prices of all other cryptocurrencies. Anyway, let’s consider those other altcoins, especially those that are lesser known.


Bitcoin is again trading near the $70,000 mark. Prices served from $61,000 at the beginning of March to $73,000 by the middle of the month. Then they corrected back to $61,000 by the 20th and have again surged back to $70,000 at the end of the month.

Myro (MYRO-USD) is an inexpensive, lesser known altcoin that cryptocurrency investors will want to pay attention to. Like everything else, Myro will benefit if Bitcoin continues to rise.

However, Myro will also benefit due to its association with Solana (SOL-USD) and the Solana network.

Solana has multiplied in value several fold in the past months. The network is exceptionally fast and inexpensive, offering an attractive alternative to Ethereum (ETH-USD) based networks.

It’s clear that Ethereum’s attempts to increase speed and decrease transaction fees has not panned out. That has opened up opportunities for Solana and associated cryptocurrencies that leverage its network.

Investing in altcoins is risky. That’s especially true of fringe altcoins like Myro. Investors are essentially gambling, but the returns are often substantial. Bitcoin is bouncing back pulling up everything — Solana included. In turn, Myro’s association with Solana should pull it higher. Another point to consider is that roughly 95% of Myro’s supply is currently circulating. That suggests that it is less susceptible to deflationary forces moving forward.

Storj (STORJ-USD) is a unique altcoin to consider and a project that has a pretty straightforward and easy to understand premise. It allows users to rent out surplus storage space on their devices in exchange for STORJ tokens. If you have hard disk space and internet connectivity you can participate in the project. Those who choose to do so will be assigned a node within the network and an equivalent quantity of STORJ.

That makes storage similar to other projects that leverage hard disk space in exchange for tokens. Yet, Storj has advantages over alternatives including Filecoin (FIL-USD) in that they are inflationary. Storj management utilizes token burning mechanisms that result in deflation.

Thus, there are a few logical reasons to invest in Storj aside from the fact that Bitcoin will pull it higher. Personally, I like the fact that the project is easy to understand. It doesn’t require a deep understanding of computer science. That should make it more accessible, leading to greater liquidity.",Solana

But with a keen eye and a bit of research, you can identify the cryptos with the most potential to ride the incoming altcoin supercycle. Let’s take a look at three I think are poised for big gains!

Sonorus (SNS-USD) is an AI-powered music platform. It went on quite the tear at the start of this month, peaking out near 30 cents in mid-March. However, the trend has since reversed and it now sits at 15 cents as of writing. I believe this may be a good level to add to positions, for those targeting outsized upside when altseason hits.

Granted, dilution could be a potential concern down the line, with 60 million tokens currently in circulation out of a whopping 1 billion maximum supply. However, the full supply likely won’t flood the market anytime soon. Besides, most small altcoins aren’t meant to be long-term holds.

Sonorus is basically combining AI and blockchain technology to produce innovative music applications. The project’s TrendFi model merges musical trends with DeFi rewards. Sonorus also features BeatMint AI, an application that lets users craft musical compositions with just a few simple prompts.

I believe this tiny altcoin has plenty of room to run. But again, no one can tell for sure if it will.

Serenity Shield (SERSH-USD) is a cybersecurity crypto that’s been flying under the radar for the past three months. Three months is an eternity when it comes to small-cap cryptos nowadays. However, with a market cap of just $3 million, Serenity Shield is a tiny project that could explode with just a little more attention.

Sure, Serenity Shield hasn’t made significant progress to the upside since its debut on CoinMarketCap. But that’s not necessarily a red flag. In fact, I believe this consolidation period presents a prime opportunity for savvy investors to get in on the ground floor. This project boasts impressive utility for its small size, and that’s what really catches my eye.

Serenity Shield has a privacy-focused StrongBox DApp technology. This patent-pending solution allows users to store data, from digital assets to confidential documents. Even better, it enables the transfer of ownership through secure inheritance to designated successors in case of an accident or the user’s passing.

Serenity Shield operates on the Solana (SOL-USD) network, so SERSH benefits from low gas fees and lightning-fast transaction speeds as well. Regardless, I’d still be very careful with investing in this token, since its market capitalization is just a minuscule $3 million.",Solana

This could act as a supply crunch for the digital asset, potentially leading to a price appreciation.

Investors 'need bitcoin in their portfolio'
According to Maconomics CEO Ross Mac, bitcoin is a necessary asset in investors' portfolios despite its volatility. Speaking to Yahoo Finance Live, Mac emphasised that bitcoin should ""absolutely"" be part of an investor's portfolio, describing it as ""a more diversified approach"" than traditional asset classes.

He noted that with bitcoin gaining exposure to institutional investors it may become ""a lot less volatile moving forward."" Mac calls Bitcoin one of the ""greatest technological advancements"" of our time, alongside artificial intelligence and the internet.

He added that since its inception, bitcoin has fallen 50% a total of eight times, yet each time has recovered and reached new highs. However, he stresses that ""it's a long-term hold,"" and investors venturing into crypto should be comfortable with volatility, although he suggests that the new ETFs should create more stability.

Chances of spot ether ETF approval drop
The global cryptocurrency market today stands at $2.79tn, an increase of 1.5% in the past 24 hours. Bitcoin makes up 48.9% the overall cryptocurrency market, whilst the second largest currency, ether, (ETH-USD) accounts for 15.4%, according to CoinGecko data.

Ether has under-performed bitcoin in the past week, up only 0.4% compared to bitcoin's 5% increase. Ether is facing challenges stemming from uncertainty surrounding the potential approval of a spot ETF by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) before a May deadline.

According to analysts from Bloomberg, the chances of a spot ether ETF being approved by the SEC in May have decreased. The Bloomberg ETF analysts cited US financial regulators' seeming lack of engagement with potential issuers over the products.

“We now believe these will ultimately be denied on May 23rd for this round,” Bloomberg Intelligence ETF analyst James Seyffart wrote in a post on X on Tuesday. Seyffart and his colleague Eric Balchunas had previously given 35% odds for approval in May.

This sales boost helped propel Ethereum to the top of the day’s blockchain rankings, CryptoSlam data shows.

Ethereum collections dominated the charts on Wednesday, as three collections claimed the top three spots.

Ethereum’s Azuki collection experienced a 263% increase in sales, amounting to US$1.54 million, the second most in the market, with transactions up by 2.67%.

Azuki is the NFT market’s eighth all-time sales leader with US$1.1 billion

Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC), another Ethereum stalwart, saw a slight uptick of 51% in sales, reaching US$1.51 million for the day’s third rank.

With the crypto market losing billions in value following Bitcoin’s (BTC-USD) recent correction, it’s not hard to see why investors are cautious.

There are varying opinions about the current volatility in the crypto market. Nevertheless, one thing is certain: the long-term bull case for the crypto space remains firmly intact regardless of the recent instability. Additionally, the upcoming halving event in April should help support crypto prices going forward. Also, many analysts feel that much of the drop in BTC’s value at this time is due to profit-taking on the part of short-term investors.


Moreover, with investing gurus such as Cathie Wood calling Bitcoin a ‘financial super highway,’ it would be imprudent to be skeptical of the market’s long-term prospects. With that said, here are three top altcoins to buy that you should add to your crypto portfolios along with Bitcoin.

Altcoins to Buy: Dogecoin (DOGE-USD)

Dogecoin (DOGE-USD) is a dog-inspired crypto that is perhaps the original meme token. True to its reputation, it has been one of the most volatile yet rewarding crypto investments. In line with the broader market uptrend, DOGE is up a striking 85% year-to-date (YTD) and over 170% in the past six months alone.

Over the years, DOGE has been criticized for offering little real-world utility, an unlimited supply, and a centralized holder base. Though it is tough to debate these criticisms, DOGE has continued to gain ground in network usage over the past year. On top of that, it’s tough to deny the massive community support, a wildcard that has kept it alive to this day.  Moreover, with the support of industry bigwigs such as Elon Musk, I don’t see DOGE going anywhere anytime soon.

Ethereum (ETH-USD)

Ethereum (ETH-USD) is the second-largest crypto by market cap and arguably the one holding the most real-world utility. In the last six months, ETH has witnessed an impressive 108% increase, mirroring the broader market trends and buoyed by the news of a potential Ethereum ETF following the approval of a Bitcoin ETF.

However, as my fellow InvestorPlace contributor Chris MacDonald discusses in a recent article, the chances of an Ethereum spot ETF approval in May are slim. Nevertheless, the SEC is delaying the inevitable, and approval will likely inject new energy into the project.

Moreover, you also have the Dencun upgrade, featuring proto-dank sharding and other improvements that aim to reduce transaction fees and boost transactions per second. Proto-dank sharding simplifies the process of data storage for Ethereum, enabling efficient transaction processing at lower costs by breaking data into smaller pieces, making the network remarkably more efficient. Lastly, Ethereum remains a key player in the Web3 space, effectively pioneering smart contracts while hosting a massive share of the total value locked in decentralized finance (DeFi).

Solana (SOL-USD)

Solana (SOL-USD) is often deemed an Ethereum killer due to its robust throughput and low transaction costs. It’s the fifth most valuable cryptocurrency, boasting a market cap exceeding $75 million at the time of writing. Solana has been incredibly popular in the NFT and DeFi realms, boasting $2.5 billion in total value locked (TVL) in the platform recently.

Moreover, its NFT ecosystem reached new milestones with more than 3.8 million transactions and a whopping $5 billion in all-time sales volume. Furthermore, Solana remains one of the most active platforms, with 3,300 active developers contributing over 40.7 million user transactions daily.

As we advance, Solana is poised for further expansion, with a planned token extension launch for intricate tokenomics, the debut of Firedancer to boost throughput, and the development of Runtime v2 to enhance network performance.",Solana

However, some cryptos have failed to keep pace, languishing with lackluster gains. On the flip side, several promising altcoins seem poised for their own rise as the market shifts from Bitcoin dominance to a full-blown altcoin season.

It seems like Bitcoin is taking a breather before its next leg up, and this consolidation phase could provide the rocket fuel needed to propel select cryptocurrencies in red-hot sectors into the stratosphere.


Two of the hottest crypto sectors during this latest bull cycle have been artificial intelligence and layer-1 blockchain platforms. Snapping up promising but lesser-known projects in these areas, along with other quality altcoins in the Web 3.0 ecosystem, looks like a winning strategy.

Cryptocurrencies with relatively small market capitalizations can deliver outsized, multibagger returns in a short period when market conditions align. Here are three cryptos to look into:

Neon EVM (NEON-USD)

Neon EVM (NEON-USD) is a promising project based on Solana (SOL-USD) that deserves attention. This algorithm uses timestamps through Solana’s proof-of-history innovation to define the next block in Solana’s chain. Given the ultra-fast speed at which blocks are added to Solana’s blockchain, additional security levels are required to maintain integrity.

This is where the proof-of-history algorithm comes in — by timestamping each block, it enables the system to preserve security even at lightning speeds.

With Ethereum (ETH-USD) gas fees surging as high as $50 for NFTs and more than $30 for a simple ERC20 swap, many developers are shifting their attention to Solana — as excessive fees on Ethereum are simply unsustainable. Cumbersome layer-2 solutions are not the answer. Blockchains like Solana that offer cheap transactions are becoming very attractive for devs.

Neon EVM can ride the tailwinds of this developer momentum. However, stability issues have hampered Solana recently, with occasional outages still occurring.

While the frequency and severity of these incidents are declining, there is optimism that the Solana team will eradicate the problem in the coming months. Once stability is cemented, Neon EVM may become irresistible to developers seeking an affordable and reliable alternative to Ethereum.

At a mere $80.6 million market cap currently, Neon EVM could easily reach over $500 million in valuation or more if it gets sufficient spotlight. The pieces are falling into place, so this is one to watch closely.",Solana

Howdy Hats also saw a substantial rise of 19.12% in sales and an 184.55% increase in transactions, as the two Solana-based collections topped the day’s sales charts, according to CryptoSlam.

Despite the market-leading performances from Solana’s NFTs, the blockchain itself trailed Ethereum and Bitcoin in blockchain NFT sales.

On the Ethereum platform, Yuga Labs’ Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) recorded a 24.48% increase in sales, reaching US$1.02 million, with a slight 5.56% uptick in transactions.

BAYC maintains its position as the second-highest in all-time sales with US$3.1 billion.

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-cryptos-ll-wish-bought-211040709.html,3 Cryptos That You’ll Wish You Bought Instead of Shiba Inu,"In the world of speculative meme tokens, Shiba Inu (SHIB-USD) remains one of the most-followed tokens. This meme project saw an incredible rise during the last crypto hype cycle, before falling markedly from its peak.

That said, with this latest round of bullish sentiment building in the market, Shiba Inu and its meme token peers are once again showing signs of life. However, given Shiba Inu’s massive size, many investors are now betting other altcoin projects could have more upside on a relative basis.


Here are three such cryptos that are better than Shiba Inu this cycle.

Jupiter (JUP)

Jupiter (JUP-USD) has been on the move over the past week, seeing significant volatility. The token has fluctuated in a range of around 70 cents to more than $1 per token, showing what many are calling a “peak and trough” pattern in terms of its technicals.

I think Jupiter certainly has the potential to break out in a big way from this range, for several reasons. A key Solana (SOL-USD) decentralized exchange aggregator, Jupiter essentially pools liquidity from various DeFi platforms. Providing token swaps with relatively low transaction fees, Jupiter has eaten significant market share on the Solana blockchain, with some estimates putting Jupiter’s market share on this network at around 80%.

Notably, Jupiter popped after the project’s developer team announced a partnership with the cat-themed token WEN Token (WEN-USD). The collaboration aimed to boost Jupiter’s message via the Jupiter Work Group (JWG) and WEN Work Group. That led to increased investor interest and market activity, propelling both JUP and WEN tokens to notable value hikes, with JUP hitting an all-time high of $1.034.

For those looking for meme-like returns from a DeFi project, Jupiter is certainly a project to keep an eye on moving forward.

Maple (MPL)

Maple (MPL-USD) stands out in the world of decentralized crypto lending, offering loans with less collateral than traditional lenders. Its recent airdrop sparked interest, boosting engagement and network activity. CEO Sid Powell aims to expand into Asian markets, emphasizing the need for clear U.S. crypto regulations.

Maple Finance dominated its DeFi rivals in the week ending February 19, seeing remarkable growth in total value locked (TVL) and revenue. Despite sluggish MPL price and modest developer activity, Maple Finance’s financial metrics surged, outpacing competitors by over tenfold.

Since its January 2024 launch, the Maple Lender Portal attracted over 300 accounts, signaling rapid market adoption. Maple Finance aimed for Asian markets in 2023 and expanded to the Base network post-Ethereum (ETH-USD) and Solana integration. CEO Sid Powell emphasized the need for clear U.S. crypto regulations, targeting capital formation and on-chain credit funds. Maple seeks to navigate Asia’s regulatory landscape by leveraging financial hubs like Hong Kong and Singapore. If the project can accomplish its global ambitions, plenty of upside could be on the horizon.

Dogwifhat (WIF-USD)
Now, for investors looking to gamble some of their hard-earned capital for big gains, Shiba Inu’s previous rise has led to an astounding market capitalization. Finding other under-the-radar meme tokens with more upside (mathematically speaking) may be the better bet.

Red-hot meme coin dogwifhat (WIF-USD) may be the project to focus on.

Personally, I’m not a fan of what I view as “hardcore” meme tokens — those with little utility aside from their core communities. However, dogwifhat certainly has a growing community and plenty of momentum. Those are the two key ingredients most speculators look for. And with the project raising $690,000 in four days, it’s clear investors are willing to put their money where their mouth is and back this token.

While dogwifhat remains highly popular and could certainly surge higher from here (that’s why it’s on the list), it’s a complete gamble of an investment. I have no idea which direction this token will trend over any given time frame. Thus, I think investing in such projects is something only those with the most incredible stomachs for volatility should take on.

That said, for those seeking life-changing returns, it’s worth talking about at the very least.",Solana

For those looking for top cryptos to sell at or near the peak, these are three I’d put in this category. Of course, further upside is always possible. But given the risks these tokens provide, it may be best to steer clear right now.

Dogwifhat (WIF-USD) has experienced a remarkable surge over the past month. The boost is sparking speculation about this token reaching $5 this month. In just a week, WIF saw a 184% surge. I

Also, it surpassed its $1.4 billion market cap, reaching a spot in the top 100 cryptocurrencies. WIF is a Solana-based project, and the meme token has been receiving optimistic support benefiting from other of Solana’s (SOL-USD) momentum.

Despite its rapid ascent, sustainability is questioned as WIF relies heavily on speculation rather than fundamentals. Analysts highlight concerning technical indicators like RSI nearing 90 and unsustainable price parabolas. Despite a recent 50% surge, investors anticipate further gains this month, influenced by market conditions.

Over the last 24 hours, Dogwifhat’s price dipped by 4.55% to $3.02, contrary to its 24.0% uptrend over the past week from $2.29. Therefore, this may be one to sell fast.",Solana
https://finance.yahoo.com/news/caution-3-meme-coins-verge-174007359.html,Caution: 3 Meme Coins on the Verge of a Major Collapse,"Meme coins are rallying again, mirroring the broader uptrend in the crypto market. Nevertheless, their reputation of offering little or no real-world utility and an abundant supply makes them incredibly volatile and unattractive for serious investors. Besides, with the market ticking in the green again, it’s prudent to ditch meme coins to avoid while focusing on higher-quality digital assets with real use cases.

A few news items may have caught the eyes of meme coin enthusiasts recently. Solana’s (SOL-USD) new BOME token shot up 20 times in value in just three hours. Moreover, Avalanche (AVAX-USD) revealed the first batch of meme coins, which fulfilled its treasury requirements. Despite these developments, it is imperative to remain coy, given the abundance of high-quality projects for investors to wager on.

Shiba Inu (SHIB)

Shiba Inu (SHIB-USD) is one of the more popular meme coins out there, but like most of its counterparts, it lacks intrinsic value. It’s often termed as a cousin to the original meme coin in Dogecoin (DOGE-USD), but unlike DOGE, it offers minimal utility in the blockchain space. Perhaps the last major event for SHIB came when Elon Musk temporarily changed the Twitter logo to the Shiba Inu image.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

To be fair, Shiba Inu effectively garnered a relatively impressive online community during hype cycles. However, just like other meme coins, it quickly lost those gains once the enthusiasm faded. In gauging SHIB’s volatility, its 50-day relative strength index is roughly 69%, which points to an overbought condition. Moreover, its historic volatility for the same period stands at an eye-watering 184.50%, indicative of the roller-coaster ride that is investing in SHIB.

ApeCoin (APE)

ApeCoin (APE-USD) is a non-fungible tokens (NFT) cryptocurrency that’s best known for its popular Bored Ape Yacht Club collection.  APE coin became incredibly popular during the crypto boom and when the interest in NFTs was at its peak. Moreover, the popularity of the Bored Ape collection propelled the meme coin to join the ranks of the top 100 cryptos by market cap. However, similar to other meme coins, there’s nothing utilitarian about it.

Furthermore, the NFT market is experiencing a sell-off of late, with price floors of some of the leading collections plummeting in value. Sales of Bored Ape NFTs are down 31.44% to just 4247, suggesting a considerable drop in demand. Additionally, its price floor, the lowest asking price for an NFT in its collection, has dropped almost 41% to 14.3ETH over the past three months. Besides, at 14.3ETH, the lowest Bored Ape NFT costs a whopping $49,232, which is good enough to buy a ton of more valuable digital assets.

Pepe (PEPE)

Pepe (PEPE-USD) is another speculative crypto that brought spectacular profits for its investors during the meme frenzy wave in the spring of last year. However, since then, it has had to grapple with multiple controversies that have weighed down investor sentiment.  Allegations of insider trading and internal theft surfaced last summer, along with the discovery of unusual transactions involving the project’s wallets.

These revelations significantly hampered confidence in PEPE, with it shedding more than 65% of its value, from April to December last year. From its launch to the end of the first half of 2023, PEPE attracted several billion dollars in trading volumes over 24 hours. However, it stands $160 million at this time, a far cry from its heyday.

Here are three high-growth cryptos I think are worth considering. These aren’t small-cap penny cryptos. Rather, they’re large and established projects with meaningful growth outlooks for the years to come.


For those looking to invest in crypto and build some core positions, here are three tokens I think are worth researching right now.

High-Growth Cryptos: Avalanche (AVAX-USD)

Avalanche (AVAX-USD), a swift and environmentally friendly blockchain platform for hosting apps and custom blockchain networks, recently introduced its Durango upgrade and the Teleporter tool. The Durango upgrade signifies a significant advancement for Avalanche, incorporating enhanced staking processes and developer tools among its new features.

Avalanche has surged by over 300% in the past year, echoing the price movements of Solana and other cryptocurrencies. Outperforming traditional assets like stocks and bonds have attracted increased attention to Avalanche, even within the crypto sector. This uptick in interest may stem from the cryptocurrency’s recent price gains and growing adoption. These are the fundamental factors that drive the bull thesis behind this layer-1 crypto in my books.

Avalanche has proven to other tokens in the market that it is a worthy challenger in the space, especially since it has similar capabilities and strengths as Ethereum (ETH-USD). Thus, for those looking for a large-cap crypto with some serious growth potential, this is a top option DeFi investors will want to consider right now.

Solana (SOL-USD)

Just a few weeks into March, Solana (SOL-USD) is dominating the crypto leaderboards. This top-5 crypto by market capitalization has surged more than 50% on a year-to-date basis alone, making this token one of the best-performing cryptos in the market.

Pantera Capital’s interest in purchasing $250 million Solana tokens from FTX added to the frenzy. The buzz around SPL meme coins and upcoming token giveaways also fueled Solana’s rise despite ongoing concerns tied to this debacle and other network stability issues in the past.

Currently emerging as one of the most potent forces in decentralized finance (DeFi), Solana is truly an Ethereum challenger worth considering. The blockchain now hosts most NFTs and web3 apps in the market, surging over 657% in half a year with a robust 50% year-to-date increase. With its excellent and reliable decentralized exchange trading, Solana shows growth and competitiveness across the DeFi and blockchain sectors.

Ethereum (ETH-USD)

After a significant 73% surge last month, Ethereum’s rally halted at $4,100. The question is now whether the bulls can push this token past $4,500 or if the $4,000 support falters. Unlike Bitcoin, Ethereum is still 22% away from its peak, facing resistance and historical accumulation clusters. On March 12, ETH retraced 2% to $3,967, triggered by high trading activity among long-term holders since 2021, as seen in on-chain data.

Ethereum’s bullish trend might face challenges ahead with a sudden influx of over $1 billion worth of ETH in the past day. Profit-taking among 1.34 million addresses, which acquired 469,540 ETH at $4,100, could favor bears, potentially pushing Ethereum toward $3,900.

Having surged more than 50% year-to-date, Ethereum’s returns mirror Bitcoin’s rise.

Ripple (XRP-USD) has not risen above $1 since 2021. Yet, right now, the attractiveness of its low price makes it a candidate for an early purchase.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

Recently on social media, former Ripple CEO Sean McBride spoke of the company’s efforts to make the Ripple coin a reliable cross-border currency. The results of this work are evident in the improved attitude of the World Bank, its recognition and attention to XRP. Such a position can change the views of users and erase concerns about the token’s performance.

This year, there have been shifts in terms of exceeding key moving averages. However, even amidst the surrounding bullish sentiment, XRP still hasn’t exceeded its annual high of more than $0.8. This indicates the coin’s untapped potential. As the alt-season heats up, the price record may be broken.

In February, Ripple acquired Standard Custody & Trust Co. By doing so, the company has expanded its licensing and achieved trust status in New York. Its list of services has grown to include asset tokenization. This move is in line with the company’s overall strategy. According to Ripple President Monica Long, the crypto company is looking to expand its infrastructure offerings for financial institutions.

Also, RippleNet is pleasing the platform’s supporters. At the beginning of the year, the number of payments per day exceeded the expectations of even ardent XRP supporters. The figure of 5 million was 25 times higher than the standard values and demonstrated a high interest in this cryptocurrency.

Algorand (ALGO-USD)

Algorand (ALGO-USD) prioritizes decentralization and security when building its blockchain platform. The project ensures that no entity has full control over the network. Recent improvements have led to the introduction of dynamic round time.

In this way, Algorand increased network throughput and reduced blocking time. This led to the overall strengthening of the blockchain as an effective tool for developers. Also, they were excited to learn that the platform supports Python, which makes building and deploying applications even easier.

The middle of 2023 was not easy for ALGO. The token dropped below $0.09 and fell out of favor with many investors. However, in the last 3 months of the year, it managed to gain $0.15. Now, the March figures raised the bar, with ALGO approaching $0.3.

Algorand plans to block 2.5 billion tokens to be distributed as participation rewards. A 2x smaller amount will be used to support the ecosystem. With this resource, the project will control inflation and increase the deficit. As an additional factor, there is a grant from the Algorand Foundation to improve compatibility with Ethereum (ETH-USD). A cool $10 million will be used to strengthen the connection between these networks. ETH has crossed the $3800 mark. ALGO’s price will react with a delay, but the rise promises to be no less exciting.",Solana

The firm is seeking to capitalize on the opportunity to buy these tokens for US$59.95 each, which is 39% below Solana’s 30-day average price.

This potential acquisition is part of a strategic investment through the Pantera Solana Fund, which targets large investors and requires a minimum investment of US$25 million.

Investors participating in this deal are expected to commit to a vesting period of up to four years, indicating Pantera’s long-term confidence in the potential of Solana.

The move comes after FTX’s collapse in November 2022, which led to a liquidity crisis and subsequent Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection filing.

FTX’s estate was granted permission by a bankruptcy court in September to sell US$3.4 billion worth of Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana, with a weekly cap of US$100 million in sales.

SOL rose 13.7% in the past 24 hours to US$147 at noon, ET, according to CoinGecko data.

SOL has the fifth-largest market capitalization in the world among cryptocurrencies with over US$65 billion.

It is also the second-most popular blockchain for NFTs, with over US$5.1 billion in sales, according to CryptoSlam data.",Solana

The entire market capitalization of the crypto sector peaked right around $3 trillion during the height of the last hype-driven mania in 2021. However, a so-called ‘crypto winter’ ensued in the last couple years, with the sector bottoming out around $900 billion. At the time of writing, the entire market is moving quickly toward a $2.5 trillion valuation, with plenty of momentum to break through to new highs.


Ethereum (ETH-USD) is certainly one of the top tokens leading the way higher, alongside the king of crypto Bitcoin (BTC-USD). Yet, there could be other more lucrative options in this sector for long-term investors seeking even greater upside. Let’s dive into three such tokens.

Solana (SOL-USD)

A well-known “Ethereum Killer,” Solana (SOL-USD) might be an excellent option to consider instead of Ethereum.

This proof-of-stake network is built on an intriguing proof-of-history consensus mechanism. Essentially, that means Solana uses time stamps to speed up the sorting of transactions. Doing so allows the network to process multiples of the typical order flow at a fraction of the cost.

Therefore, this speed and cost advantage are reasons most investors like Solana. The network has become synonymous with the NFT space, given the fact that many transactions are for smaller dollar amounts. Ethereum’s network, which can charge hefty gas fees for its usage, isn’t as well-suited for such purposes. Hence, the real-world utility Solana has been able to generate.

Additionally, while Ethereum focuses more on gradual upgrades, Solana is known for innovative solutions such as their Saga phone and successful crypto strategies. These high-growth strategies make this token more compelling for those seeking outsized gains, at least during this bull market rally.

Avalanche (AVAX-USD)

It was only in 2020 when Ava Labs launched Avalanche (AVAX-USD). This new blockchain offers seamless automated contract executions through its smart contract support. Also, Avalanche focuses on enhancing scalability and usability. This allows the blockchain to handle thousands of transactions per second.

One of the best features investors love about Avalanche compared to Ethereum is its relative cost-effectiveness. Like Solana, Avalanche offers transaction fees that are a fraction of the cost, which is rare for other blockchains to offer.

As of the time of writing, Avalanche is the 10th-largest crypto based on market capitalization. AVAX’s consensus protocol facilitates node collaboration, ensuring transaction processing. It boosts security by randomly verifying validators’ confirmations, enhancing transaction legitimacy. Additionally, its three-blockchain structure resolves common blockchain issues, offering scalability, interoperability, and user-friendliness. This sets Avalanche apart in the blockchain sector and is the core thesis for owning this token for the long-term.",Solana
https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bitcoin-keeps-running-owning-3-182229190.html,"If Bitcoin Keeps Running, Owning These 3 Cryptos Could Make You Rich","As we continue into March, investors have already seen the dynamic evolution of cryptocurrency markets this year. Several key catalysts have driven this sector higher, with the recent approval of spot Bitcoin (BTC-USD) ETFs being the most recent catalyst. These ETFs have seen more than $10 billion of capital inflows, marking some of the fastest capital accumulation in this space ever. That’s something to write home about and a factor many conservative investors are now noting.

With more institutional capital flowing into this space, it’s clear that select cryptocurrencies are gaining traction. While Bitcoin is leading the way, other projects looking to redefine the future of finance may outperform.


With that in mind, let’s dive into three cryptos that I think have the potential to provide significant upside from here for those looking to play this near-term rally or for longer-term capital appreciation upside.

Ethereum’s (ETH-USD) likening to digital oil underscores its centrality in DeFi. Vitalik Buterin envisioned Ethereum as a global cryptocurrency computer, and Ethereum’s introduction of smart contracts allowed this network to dominate the decentralized finance world. Ethereum’s pivotal role in digital finance ensures its ongoing influence, akin to oil’s significance in the traditional economy. Indeed, it’s the best comparison many can provide, with Ethereum already considered a commodity by regulators—something that could drive continued excitement in this token.

Altcoin Sherpa, a crypto analyst, predicted Ethereum’s potential rise to $4,000. Much of this positive sentiment has to do with Ethereum’s technical indicators. However, other investors and analysts point to the likelihood that Ethereum could also see a spot ETF approved as early as May, which would certainly catalyze more capital toward the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency.

Additionally, upgrades like Single Slot Finality promise faster transactions and increased scalability, attracting investors seeking digital wealth. Thus, Ethereum has to be on the buy list for those looking for innovation and disruption in this space right now.

Solana (SOL)

Reaching a peak at $135, Solana (SOL-USD) is now riding the broader market wave higher alongside Bitcoin. Some price predictions have Solana reaching $260 by 2024, driven by this network’s speed and cost advantage relative to its peers.

Now ranking at fifth spot by market capitalization, Solana has seen a surge of more than 120% in its daily trading volume. This now equates to $3.2 million, with many anticipating higher numbers moving forward. Investor confidence in Solana’s potential drove this increase. Solana’s Total Value Locked (TVL) rebounded, aiming for pre-FTX levels and showing steady growth since October 2023.

For investors looking to play the decentralized finance realm from the angle of transaction volume, I think Solana is the way to play this trend. It’s a top Ethereum competitor and continues to gobble up market share. An uptick in NFT sales is among the factors driving this token higher, but if more utility-generating projects jump aboard, I think there’s plenty of room for upside over the long term. That is, so long as the Solana team can keep its network stable (outages have been a pain in the side of investors in recent years).

Bitcoin Cash (BCH)

One of the best cryptos to buy as Bitcoin is gaining more popularity is Bitcoin Cash (BCH-USD). Bitcoin Cash is also an alternative payment blockchain focused on real-world projects. With stable price action around $260, it’s a top pick for momentum-driven investors, poised for higher gains.

As its name suggests, Bitcoin Cash is a project similar to Bitcoin but focused on the payments space. Interestingly, volume on this network has surged, with investors pointing to increased adoption in crypto payments as a key reason to invest in this crypto.

This is a relatively easy thesis to understand with a smaller valuation and higher upside tied to fundamental catalysts. Bitcoin Cash should also benefit from Bitcoin’s halving, with demand on this network likely to surge should transaction costs on the Bitcoin network rise as well.

All in all, I think Bitcoin Cash is probably the most speculative pick of these three. However, I think a well-balanced crypto portfolio can hold all three tokens and benefit from the diversification.",Solana

Solana

Known as the “Ethereum killer,” Solana (SOL-USD) is one to buy if you want 1000% gains. Since Ethereum’s debut in 2015, ETH has revolutionized the crypto world with smart contracts and enabled DeFi and NFTs. In 2019, Solana emerged, challenging Ethereum’s dominance through its faster transaction time and low fees.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

Solana surged over 95% from $9 in the “crypto winter” to over $100 today, driven by broader market momentum and ecosystem growth. Key metrics like active addresses and transactions signal Solana’s promising future. Meanwhile, Ethereum saw a modest 90% gain amidst Solana’s 900% surge. While Ethereum remains busy, Solana is closing the gap.

Despite predictions of its downfall amid ties to FTX’s Sam Bankman-Fried, Solana persevered. Active addresses neared 2022 levels, and new addresses overgrew. Capital efficiency surpassing Ethereum indicates Solana’s resilience. Leadership played a crucial role in Solana’s recovery and growth post-FTX. Therefore, I expect this project’s solid team to continue delivering outsized growth in the near- to medium-term.

Jupiter

Speaking of Solana, Jupiter (JUP-USD) is the leading decentralized exchange aggregator in the Solana ecosystem. Currently, it offers normal swaps and other perpetual contracts and services to traders. The hope is that the Jupiter ecosystem will continue to grow. This is a best-in-class network with some of the greatest prices and trading options (tokens on its network).

For investors who view the Solana blockchain as the place where most trading will be done in the future (due to the network’s speed and low cost), Jupiter is an easy way to ride this momentum. As an aggregator, Jupiter benefits from trader activity, regardless of whichever dApp fuels the activity.

Over the long-term, I think Jupiter is a top way to play Solana’s growth. More on-chain users and usage should continue to drive valuation growth for this token. Currently, JUP is undervalued relative to its potential (in my view).

Maple’s (MPL-USD) is among the top crypto players in the world of decentralized lending. It provides various loans to market makers and market participants, with the goal of democratizing the way capital is lent within the crypto ecosystem. Under-secured loans, using less collateral than most other lenders, which require overcollateralization, could catch on. And, for Maple investors, the hope is that such a trend will continue for years and decades to come.

Notably, Maple’s recent airdrop has generated excitement around this project, shining a light on the token and platform. Active wallets received Maple tokens, enhancing engagement. The fast, low-cost network proved ideal for innovative crypto events. This airdrop spurred interactions with dApps and NFTs, enriching user experiences and fostering innovation. Thus, Maple’s approach showcases strategic airdrops’ power to bolster blockchain and currency use cases.

Maple Airdrop caused a stir in the crypto community, attracting traders with potential gains akin to meme tokens. Platform usage surged, injecting vitality and boosting network activity and visibility.

Additionally, the Maple Lender Portal has gained 300+ accounts since January 2024, indicating rapid adoption and expansion to the Base network after Ethereum and Solana. Also, Maple eyes Asian markets. CEO Sid Powell advocates clear U.S. crypto regulations.",Solana

Video Transcript
SEANA SMITH: Let's take a look at Ethereum. We have certainly seen a rally play out now well above a $3,000, crossing above that $3,100 level. Jared Blikre has a closer look at this rally that we've seen, and exactly, I guess, why we're seeing this rally, and what this could mean here for what's ahead, Jared.

JARED BLIKRE: Yeah. Sometimes it's difficult to tease out the catalyst and the true meaning and origins behind these moves. But one of the reasons-- so two things happening actually. There is a spot Ethereum ETF. There's lots of hype around that. Very similar to the spot Bitcoin ETF.

But there's also an upgrade scheduled for March 12. It then can upgrade. That's supposed to make it more quick, more compatible, actually more faster with respect to Solana. I guess that's the word I was looking for.

I do find it interesting that over the last three days, Ethereum has been up 4.1% while Solana competitor is down about 7/10 of a percent. So I think, Seana, that actually gives some weight to that potential argument that this is, in fact, about the upgrade.

But let's take a look at the price action. This is over the last three days. We actually punched above $3,000 a few days ago over the weekend. And let me just show you a five-year view. So we can see those record highs right around $5,000.

Now, as it happens, a lot of times, when we don't have a lot of price history, we've just gone straight up, sometimes it pauses at these big psychological levels. $3,000 was a level. $3,500 is a level right here. $4,000 is a level. So we'll have to watch these, as we keep heading higher here. But it looks like there's a lot of fuel in the tank for crypto.

We have the Bitcoin halvening. That's Bitcoin, not Ethereum, but there's-- it does create a lot of excitement around Bitcoin and crypto, in general, when we have these halvenings. And that's going to happen in April.

Every time that's happened before, that has kicked off a crypto supercycle. So we could be in store for that as well. And since I mentioned Solana, even though it's a laggard over the last few days, here's a look at Solana over the last five years. This was an even more parabolic chart that we saw a couple of years ago in its rise.

But I'm checking out this consolidation here. And let me put a three-month chart on. This is a pretty tight formation. And I got to think with price coming off of these lows very quickly, and then taking a few months to regroup, that only makes it more likely that whenever we launch beyond this point, that this will be used as a support base.

So for instance, if we were able to launch up here, come back down, these levels right in here around $100, $105 should theoretically act as support. Guys?

SEANA SMITH: All right. Jared, thanks so much for breaking that down. Certainly, seems like, at least, for now, the crypto bull market getting just a bit wider.",Solana

In a complete shift to 2023 trading patterns, Ethereum (ETH:USD) surged 28% in 2024, outpacing Bitcoin’s 21% gain. This is a display of Ethereum’s increasing dominance in the world of DeFi, and the corresponding benefit investors are applying to this token. Indeed, $5.2 billion poured into the market after U.S. regulators gave the nod to spot Bitcoin ETFs, with rumors of Ether ETFs now driving much of the price action in this sector. Many eyes are now closely watching the decisions made by regulators.

Additionally, Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin is excited about the Dencun upgrade being just right around the corner in March. This upgrade aims to sharpen Ethereum’s efficiency, scalability, and security. This will mark the start of Ethereum’s “The Surge” era, following the transition to Proof-of-Stake. Also, the integration of Verkle Trees has everyone on the edge of their seats.

Bitcoin continues to see strong momentum form after after the SEC gave the nod to spot Bitcoin ETFs. If Ethereum is next to follow suit, it could be a key token to watch moving forward.

Have you missed out on Solana’s (SOL-USD) unanticipated “Uptober” spike? It’s okay.

A decline may be on the horizon, providing an opportunity for investors left on the outside looking in after this spike. Certain technical factors such as an overheated RSI and shrinking acquisition volume are ringing alarm bells for traders. However, I remain bullish on Solana’s long-term potential.

Recently, Solana’s DeFi ecosystem experienced a 200% surge in value, reaching $2 billion in total value locked (TVL) from $688 million in December. This was fueled by liquid staking and yield protocols. Solana, one of the five cryptocurrencies in terms of market capitalization, broke through the key $100 level once again. Clearly, this signals renewed institutional interest.

Solana’s DeFi ecosystem has rebounded from December, bouncing to $2.028B TVL per DeFiLlama. This number is low compared to its high in 2021. Therefore, Solana still has strong investment potential for those who think this rebound can pick up steam.",Solana

Bonk will not be the first meme for Revolut as Ethereum-based Dogecoin and Shiba Inu are already trading on the platform. However, it can become one of the first Solana-based meme projects offered by a global neobank.

Revolut is used by over 30 million retail customers, according to its website.

As the primary driver behind Web 3.0 innovation, Ethereum seems poised for tremendous growth in 2024.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

The top decentralized applications and NFT projects continue to be built on Ethereum, cementing its status as the leading smart contract platform.

Importantly, Ethereum recently transitioned to a proof-of-stake consensus model. This greatly reduced the issuance rate of new Ethereum tokens, making the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency deflationary for the first time. With Ethereum’s burn rate now exceeding that of its mint rate, a supply shock could strongly benefit prices. Additionally, as more developers build Web 3.0 apps on Ethereum, demand for Ethereum via transactions on its network should continue climbing.

I’m especially bullish on Ethereum due to this network’s ties to some of the most promising metaverse, DeFi, and NFT projects that rely on the Ethereum network. These applications relay on Ethereum to power transactions and run smart contracts. As these nascent sectors grow, Ethereum adoption should surge as well. With strong network effects firmly in place, I expect Ethereum to continue to outpace Bitcoin’s gains.

Ethereum also boasts top-notch security with its large community of validators. Attacks are virtually impossible at this scale. Thus, with no serious “Ethereum killer” in sight yet, Ethereum enjoys a dominant position in the world of Web 3.0 infrastructure. Unless unforeseen circumstances arise, I believe the runway is clear for Ethereum to exponentially increase in value in 2024.

Scalability remains one of the biggest challenges in the crypto realm. However, Kaspa (KAS-USD) offers an elegant solution with its cutting-edge blockDAG protocol called GHOSTDAG.

Unlike traditional blockchains, GHOSTDAG leverages a directed acyclic graph structure. This allows parallel blocks to coexist, while allowing the network to maintain quick consensus ordering. As a result, Kaspa can handle extremely high throughput with miniscule transaction confirmation times.

Innovative architectures like GHOSTDAG will become highly valued as scalability pressures increase across decentralized networks. By avoiding the inefficiency of wasted orphaned blocks, Kaspa unlocks a lean and effective scaling approach that is not bogged down by excessive hardware requirements.

From my first recommendation of Kaspa back at 2 cents back in July 2023, this token has already climbed 600% to 14 cents at the time of this writing. Yet, its current $3-billion market cap still seems small compared to its potential. As developers recognize the scalability promise of GHOSTDAG, Kaspa could achieve a market cap of $10 billion or more.

In an era where high Ethereum fees occasionally throttle applications, blockchain projects would do well to evaluate alternatives like Kaspa. Its novel hybrid PoW/PoS consensus and ability to run public and private networks make Kaspa surprisingly versatile. For these reasons, I believe this project has plenty of upside ahead, despite already generous gains for early investors.

Libra Incentix (LIXX-USD) seems positioned for a major breakout in 2024 driven by high-profile partnerships at the intersection of sports and commerce. Libra’s loyalty platform has teamed up with ComAve, an online shopping portal which has surged in popularity due to its partnerships with major football clubs like AC Milan and Crystal Palace.

Additionally, Libra Incentix is collaborating with Tamias POS, which also continues to secure deals with prominent sports teams and brands. As the exclusive loyalty token provider for these platforms, Libra offers fans a tokenized incentive program.

This focus on mainstream sports partnerships marks just the initial phase in Libra becoming the most widely adopted crypto loyalty solution. By catering to the massive global sports fan demographic, Libra Incentix can drive significant organic user growth and transaction volume for its network.

The opportunities appear tremendous still. The sports industry is on pace to reach a staggering $681 billion valuation by 2031, and I think this number could be higher as it benefits from crypto adoption.

With LIXX serving as the backbone loyalty mechanism across multiple major players in this booming niche, this project’s real-world usage is set to accelerate exponentially. As the LIXX token becomes deeply integrated into mainstream fan experiences and shopping through influential partners, Libra may emerge as one of the most promising crypto projects in terms of user reach.

Solana (SOL-USD)

While Ethereum remains the dominant smart contract platform, “Ethereum killers” like Solana (SOL-USD) have managed to carve out solid market share in areas like NFTs. With transaction fees under 1 cent, Solana provides a fast and ultra-affordable blockchain environment for developers. This has fueled tremendous adoption, despite Solana’s previous struggles with stability (given a number of big outages).

However, the Solana team continues refining the network, and outages are becoming less frequent. As demand for scalable Layer 1 solutions grows exponentially in 2024 and beyond, Solana’s upside remains enormous at these levels.

Unless catastrophic failures occur, significant market share gains from Ethereum seem likely as congestion and high gas fees push developers to seek alternative platforms to build on. I think Solana’s unique infrastructure could solve Ethereum’s speed and cost problem, making this a top token to consider for long-term growth.",Solana

The Saga phone is part of Solana’s broader ambition to expand its ecosystem and make decentralized finance (DeFi) and other blockchain services more accessible.

Solana’s first phone, Saga, was designed to provide a seamless interface for cryptocurrency transactions and decentralized applications (dapps), making it easier for users to manage their digital assets on the go.

Although initially criticized for its US$1,000 price tag, Saga owners were compensated with complementary crypto assets, including ones that were later airdropped.

Solana blockchain has the second-highest sales volume for non-fungible tokens (NFT) with over US$4.9 billion, behind Ethereum’s US$42 billion, according to CryptoSlam data.

Solana’s network is often criticized for frequent outages. Its most recent outage, which occurred last week, broke the blockchain’s streak of staying online for almost a year without disruptions.

Each of the three cryptos below has a unique catalyst investors are watching closely. I think these tokens have real long-term value and could certainly go on a run if the sector sees strong momentum again. There’s always the potential for another interest rate cut-fueled rally later this year.


With that said, let’s look at these three top cryptos.

The world’s second-largest cryptocurrency, Ethereum (ETH-USD), doesn’t require an introduction. The backbone of the DeFi sector, Ethereum is commonly associated with its smart contract platform, being the first major player in utility generation in the crypto space.

For optimistic investors, a potential SEC-approved Ethereum spot ETF could attract more institutional interest to this token. While uncertainty remains around whether such an ETF will ultimately get approved, I think such news would likely have an outsized impact on Ethereum relative to Bitcoin.

That’s because Ethereum provides users with real-world value and has a much more robust ecosystem of decentralized applications. With the network now operating under a proof-of-stake consensus, there’s also the option of earning yield by staking Ethereum tokens. Thus, the range of ETF offerings could be more vast and intriguing than those provided for Bitcoin.

This is the under-the-radar catalyst investors should focus on regarding Ethereum.

Solana (SOL-USD)

Solana (SOL-USD) excels in the world of layer one networks—Solana’s speedy transactions position the blockchain well as key competitors to Ethereum in the burgeoning DeFi sector. With more than $1.57 billion in total value locked, Solana is the primary blockchain investors are focused on when it comes to the world of non-fungible tokens (NFTs).

I think a resurgence of growth for NFTs could be a hidden catalyst that Solana investors aren’t focusing on. Solana’s recent NFT boom facilitated $2.1 billion in stablecoin transfers, generating $591,416 in fees and $850 million in trading volume. That’s something to write home about. Accordingly, analysts foresee continued growth on the horizon, with the token hitting as much as $150 apiece if this rally continues.

I have to admit another NFT surge does seem unlikely, and I have yet to see many widespread and viable use cases for these tokens. However, value is in the eye of the beholder, and if we do see an NFT renaissance, Solana ought to be a go-to token to consider.

Aptos (APT-USD)

Aptos (APT-USD) has seen some rather impressive upward surges in recent months. Indeed, after settling below $5 per token late last year, Aptos now trades closer to the $9 range. That’s the kind of growth investors are after.

Aptos’ collaborations with various blockchain networks and prominent crypto figures position it as a promising asset. In early January, Aptos surged as OKX endorsed its NFT inscriptions. This move affirmed Aptos as a leading blockchain for NFTs, leveraging its unique Move programming language. If more partnerships and listings are announced, Aptos could be an under-the-radar token with the potential to move much higher.

Of course, betting on future catalysts that are uncertain is, in itself, a risky strategy. But Aptos’ network growth and its surge into a top-30 spot by market capitalization seems to validate the market’s view that this project has underlying value.",Solana

Solana is a popular blockchain for decentralized finance applications and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). But since the network launched in March 2020, it has faced technical challenges due to frequent network outages.

However, the blockchain has been running without interruptions for almost a year. The blockchain’s last outage occurred last April, when it was down for almost two days, according to CoinDesk.

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-cryptos-buy-coming-ethereum-194527628.html,3 Cryptos to Buy Before the Coming Ethereum Upgrade,"Ethereum’s (ETH-USD) dominance as the leading smart contract and Web 3.0 platform is facing its most significant test yet. The upcoming Deneb/Cancun upgrade could once again revolutionize interest in this token. However, it’s also an upgrade that comes with some element of risk. Thus, it’s wise to align your portfolio to benefit from any potential impact of this upgrade, and do so in a way that limits your downside exposure.

The main feature of this upgrade is called proto-danksharding. In plain English, this scaling solution should make Ethereum layer 2 rollups much faster and cheaper to use. For those unaware, rollups move computation and data storage off the main Ethereum chain. However, these computations still retain the underlying security and decentralization Ethereum provides.


Proto-danksharding allows large blobs of transaction data to be stored briefly on the main chain, just long enough for validation, before getting passed along to rollups. This eliminates the need for expensive calldata that has previously congested the Ethereum network.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

While the upgrade could be a huge boost for many Web 3.0 projects built on smart contracts or reliant on transaction speeds, Web 3.0 assets remain highly speculative. As such, I only recommend allocating a small portion of your crypto portfolio to chase the upside in these tokens.

With that said, here are three cryptos to buy ahead of this major upgrade.

Ethereum (ETH-USD)

As the dominant smart contract and Web 3.0 ecosystem, Ethereum has the most to gain from its ambitious Deneb/Cancun upgrade. While the upgrade aims to solve Ethereum’s nagging fee issues, Vitalik Buterin has hinted that base gas costs may still rise, keeping prices high for end users. However, developers could have a field day with greatly-improved layer-2 efficiency. This might just be enough to retain developers into Ethereum’s orbit, rather than losing talent to rival chains like Solana (SOL-USD) or Avalanche (AVAX-USD).

I remain adamantly bullish on Ethereum heading into the upgrade event. As a deflationary cryptocurrency, growing demand for Ethereum tokens fueled by Web3 apps should drive prices higher. And with Ethereum hosting most smart contract-based platforms, demand is likely to increase over time. Deneb/Cancun will be a definitive test of Ethereum’s technical prowess and its ability to meet user needs.

Beyond the upgrade, there are some promising emergent use cases that could propel Ethereum adoption. Decentralized finance (DeFi) retains strong activity, decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) are on the rise, non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are transforming digital ownership and asset provenance, and even central banks are experimenting with the prospect of central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) on Ethereum. As both a crypto asset and a decentralized network powering Web3, Ethereum remains a top long-term buy.

Optimism (OP-USD)

As a leading layer-2 scaling solution utilizing optimistic rollups for Ethereum, Optimism (OP-USD) checks all the boxes as a top Deneb/Cancun speculative buy. The project aims to provide faster and cheaper transactions for Ethereum dApps like decentralized exchanges, gaming platforms, and social networks.

Importantly, Optimism is EVM-compatible, meaning developers can deploy existing smart contracts on Optimism with minimal effort. While the network is currently live, supporting prominent apps like Uniswap (UNI-USD), Synthetix (SNX-USD), and Chainlink (LINK-USD), wider usage has been hampered by throughput constraints. This could change in a big way once Optimism leverages proto-danksharding and blobs to enhance its rollups.

Optimism offers an encouraging early sign of its upgrade readiness. Its team recently implemented the Ecotone hard fork on the Optimism Goerli test network. This hard fork trial enabled batch submission via EIP-4844 blobs, verifying that Optimism will hit the ground running with blob support on mainnet post-upgrade.

With strong fundamentals and a 25% market share of total value locked in layer-2 platforms at over $5.4 billion, Optimism looks poised to capitalize on the greater efficiency unlocked by Deneb/Cancun. As rollup activity expands, Optimism could be one of the biggest beneficiaries of Ethereum’s push to scale.

0xGasless (0XGAS-USD) is a Web 3.0 project focused squarely on expanding Ethereum’s addressable market by eliminating gas fees. It’s a great choice for investors seeking outsized upside from higher Ethereum transaction volumes after the upgrade.

At the core of 0xGasless’ offering is support for ERC-4337 and account abstraction. This is a standard that replaces traditional externally owned accounts (EOAs) with smart contract wallets. These wallets feature built-in logic for transaction validation, authorization, and, crucially – gas payment. This shields users from managing seed phrases, paying volatile gas fees directly and losing funds to theft or mistakes.

0xGasless also offers intriguing functionality that could hasten mainstream adoption. For example, users can deploy ERC-4337 smart contract wallets on the user-friendly Telegram platform. Additionally, a custom paymaster service enables gas fee payment using any ERC-20 token.

Projects like 0xGasless building on account abstraction and user experience have asymmetric upside. The road to mass adoption starts by allowing users to easily access Ethereum applications without crypto’s usual harsh learning curve.",Solana
https://finance.yahoo.com/news/solana-jupiter-trading-volume-skyrockets-184529533.html,Solana’s Jupiter trading volume skyrockets ahead of JUP airdrop,"Jupiter, a Solana-based liquidity aggregator and decentralized exchange (DEX), has witnessed a significant increase in trading volumes, as the platform prepares for the issuance of its native token, JUP.

The increase in volume suggests that traders are positioning themselves to benefit from the Jan. 31 JUP airdrop. An airdrop is a method commonly used in the cryptocurrency space to distribute tokens to users, often to encourage adoption and usage of a new platform or currency.

The Solana ecosystem competes with other blockchains like Ethereum for dominance in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space and non-fungible tokens (NFTs).

Solana’s total value locked (TVL), or the amount of crypto assets deposited in DeFi platforms, stood at US$1.40 billion at the time of writing, making it the fifth-largest DeFi chain in the world, according to DeFiLlama data. Ethereum hosts the world’s largest DeFi ecosystem with US$31.4 billion in TVL.

Trading activity on Jupiter has been comparable to that seen on established platforms like Ethereum-based Uniswap, currently ranked as the world’s largest DEX with US$4.1 billion in TVL.

Solana is also the world’s second-most active blockchain for NFTs, with US$4.8 billion in all-time sales behind Ethereum’s US$42.4 billion.

In December, Solana’s US$365.48 million barely edged Ethereum’s NFT sales volume of US$363.45 million.

Even if the recent metaverse and NFT frenzies have cooled, Ethereum still stands as the leading blockchain underpinning countless decentralized apps and services.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

Ethereum’s key edge over Bitcoin relates to its support for smart contracts and advanced functionality beyond payments. As the dominant Web3 blockchain, most projects being built in areas like DeFi, NFTs, and the metaverse, increasingly rely on Ethereum’s global computing network. Users of these apps must pay gas fees in Ethereum, creating perpetual demand even during bear markets.

This wide utility and role as the “fuel” of Web3 is why Ethereum has massively outperformed Bitcoin in previous bull runs. And with the major Dencon upgrade slated to launch by mid-2024, I expect Ethereum’s advantage over Bitcoin to widen further in the next cycle. Dencon aims to slash Ethereum gas fees by up to 90% while accelerating layer-2 scaling solutions.

So, if we do get an influx of new crypto buyers and restore Web3 hype, I anticipate Ethereum providing major upside. We could see surging decentralized application usage, NFT sales volume growth, and higher gas consumption pushing Ethereum prices significantly higher, perhaps even to new highs. For broad exposure to a potential Web3 resurgence, Ethereum remains the leading crypto to consider.

Solana (SOL-USD)

Even if the upcoming Dencon cuts Ethereum fees and enhances layer-2 capabilities, transacting and building on Ethereum will likely remain pricier and more cumbersome than alternatives like Solana (SOL-USD).

With lightning-fast speeds and rock-bottom fees, Solana presents a compelling Web3 option for both developers and users. It has already successfully peeled off market share from Ethereum in NFT trading volume and other areas like DeFi.

I expect the network effects and composability benefits of building on a high-activity chain like Solana to help it gain additional traction if we enter a fresh bull cycle, particularly if congestion and high gas fees resurface on Ethereum amid surging usage.

Of course, Solana still has progress to make, notably in improving its network reliability and uptime. However, the Solana team has made big strides in optimizing stability and mitigating outages over the past year.

Given the immense room for adoption and growth, I think Solana’s price levels around $90 per token seem attractive. Despite its early-stage flaws, Solana remains one of my top altcoin picks for mega returns if the Web3 and metaverse themes catch fire again.

Render Token (RNDR-USD)

Unlike Ethereum and Solana, which are essentially generalized Web3 blockchains, Render Token (RNDR-USD) and the Render Network target a specific niche – GPU graphics processing power.

Render operates a network that lets users easily buy and sell excess graphics and compute resources for rendering 3D visuals, animations, models, and more. This on-demand access allows smaller creators to tap into strong GPU performance without substantial up-front investment.

As metaverse and Web3 content creation pick back up, Render stands to see surging demand from various verticals like architectural and product visualization, special effects, advertisements, video game development, and VR/AR experiences.

In fact, Render’s native token RNDR has already rocketed higher in recent months – surging from around 40 cents to current levels approaching $4. I expect this momentum to continue over 2023 and 2024 if the overall environment improves for cryptos and its futuristic applications.",Solana
https://finance.yahoo.com/news/high-risk-high-reward-why-111700359.html,"High-Risk, High-Reward: Why Solana Could See 3,600% Gains — or Crash!","It’s not a Bitcoin (BTC-USD) killer or an Ethereum (ETH-USD) killer. Yet, Solana (SOL-USD) does have properties that set it apart from other cryptocurrencies. After learning as much as you can about Solana, you may be tempted to dip in with a small, long-term position.

However, be prepared for the SOL-USD price to make big moves in either direction. As we’ll see, one financial firm envisions a very wide potential price range for Solana. So, put on your seat belt as we delve into the details and find out what’s so special about Solana.

Solana: Pushing the Envelope With Speed and Efficiency
What sets Solana apart from ultra-popular Bitcoin and Ethereum? As Solana’s official website explains, the Solana network is “engineered for widespread, mainstream use by being energy efficient, lightning fast, and extremely inexpensive.” It’s also touted as being scalable, meaning that it has the “ability to grow.”


InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

Believe it or not, the average transaction cost for Solana is just $0.00025. Solana is lightning-fast with block times of 400 milliseconds and, as of Jan. 22, speeds of 2,663 transactions per second.

Again, Solana shouldn’t be considered an Ethereum killer. Yet, InvestorPlace contributor Omor Ibne Ehsan brought up a notable point. “If Ethereum gets clogged in 2024’s bull market rally, developers and liquidity could readily migrate to faster alternatives like Solana,” Ehsan considered.

In addition, the Solana network is ideal for producing non-fungible tokens. As of Jan. 22, 21.9 million NFTs had been minted on the Solana network. This is another consideration that could make Solana more interesting than many other cryptocurrencies.

No Middle Ground for Solana
If Solana sounds intriguing to you, that’s understandable, but don’t mortgage your house to buy it. The key here is moderation, as the SOL-USD price is quite volatile and could either soar or plummet.

More or less, following the trajectory of Bitcoin, Solana recently spiked above $120 but then pulled back to $87. This presents a dip-buying opportunity, but don’t make a move until you’ve heard what VanEck analysts/strategists Patrick Bush and Matthew Sigel have to say.

Bush and Sigel wrote, “By 2030, our Solana valuation scenarios project a SOL price ranging from a bearish $9.81 to a bullish $3,211.28.” This prediction range is “anchored by varied market shares and revenue estimations across key sectors.”

Their prediction involves a “scenario in which Solana is the first blockchain to host an application that onboards 100M+ users.”

Of course, there’s no guarantee that this will actually occur, so consider it a bullish proposition.

But then, it’s also not an impossible scenario. Optimistically, Bush and Sigel “see a credible path to $8B in revenues for SOL token holders by 2030.” It’s a possibility worth considering, but not betting your life savings on.

Solana: Dare to Dream, but Stay Grounded
Doing the math, it looks like Solana could rally by nearly 3,600% if it rises from $87 to $3,211.28. However, that’s at the extreme upper boundary of Bush and Sigel’s forecast range.

The lower end of that range suggests that the SOL-USD price could drop to just $9.81. To prepare for this possibility, it’s wise to maintain a very small stake in Solana. That way, you’ll be positioned for glory but also won’t get hurt too badly if Solana crashes and burns.",Solana

He added that tokenising real-world assets, such as financial products, real estate, and even art, on a blockchain could provide increased accessibility and liquidity, allowing for easier and more efficient trading.

Moreover, using blockchain's unchangeable and decentralised features could make things more transparent and secure. These tokenised products can also be programmed with ""smart contracts"" to create new trading methods.

Benefits of tokenisation
""There are two big benefits of tokenising real world assets. The first is the efficiency gains. So by having more real world assets populated on the blockchain, you'll actually unlock efficiency. So the financial market itself will become more efficient,"" De Maere told Yahoo Finance UK.

""There are multiple ways you can increase efficiency in real estate, but one that excites me a lot is around capital formation by having your assets represented on the blockchain,"" he added.

De Maere said tokenisation allows for the dividing of asset ownership into fractions of any size. ""Fractionalisation is where you actually split up the ownership of your asset, which could be a house, which usually belongs to one person, into multiple pieces. This could allow you to sell off specific percentages of your house to other people,"" he said.

Participation of large financial players
Some players in financial markets, such as banks, asset managers, and financial institutions, are currently exploring the utilisation of blockchain to tokenise real-world assets, according to De Maere.

""Big financial players, like banks and asset managers and some of the institutional players are all exploring tokenisation through pilot programmes.

Bitcoin (BTC-USD) Is bound to be featured throughout lists of must-buy coins in 2024. Of course, introducing Bitcoin ETFs is vitally important to that narrative.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

A lot can be said about Bitcoin ETFs, but one of the most interesting is how big of a win this is for the crypto industry. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) finally acquiesced more than a decade after the first Bitcoin ETF application was filed in July 2013.

From that perspective, the launch of Bitcoin ETFs is indeed a watershed moment. The victory itself speaks to the continued rapid evolution of cryptocurrency overall. Cryptocurrency continues moving away from the realm of Ponzi schemes and into everyday finance.

One of the most interesting things to watch is whether Bitcoin can test former highs in 2024. BTC prices reached $65,000 in late 2021. Then, they plummeted as the Federal Reserve rapidly increased interest rates to battle the inflation period. We are now on the other side of that battle. It is all speculation, but it’s reasonable to anticipate that BTC prices will exceed $65,000 this year.

Solana (SOL-USD)

Solana (SOL-USD) prices have moved up and down in the lead up to the launch of Bitcoin ETFs. The launch of those ETFs has led to speculation that Solana can recover rapidly after losing substantial ground since late December.

These articles rely on technical indicators to substantiate their bullish thesis for future prices. It’s all good and well, and interesting insights can be gained from technical analysis. However, investors should also simply rely on obvious catalysts.

Solana has again passed $100, presumably due to the launch of Bitcoin ETFs. Moving forward, Solana can continue to appreciate due to its fundamental strength. In reality, Solana is more connected to Ethereum than it is Bitcoin.

That’s where it continues to have the most potential to appreciate. The more it can prove its abilities related to speed and efficiency, the more market share it will claw away from Ethereum. A $5 investment resulting in a $500 return is unrealistic, given what that would mean for Solana’s market capitalization. Instead, expect more realistic potential returns in the neighborhood of 50%, which is impressive.

Are Ethereum (ETH-USD) ETFs up next? That’s one of the major questions cryptocurrency investors are curious about after Bitcoin ETF launches.

It’s also one of the reasons to consider that Ethereum prices could rise higher. That would be welcome news for Ethereum investors who have already benefited as Ethereum surges higher; during the lead up to the launch of Bitcoin ETFs, Ethereum’s price increased by as much as 12%. That has renewed optimism in the second most valuable cryptocurrency while propelling Ethereum to scale more cryptos.

The SEC is expected to begin handing out decisions about Ethereum ETFs in May. That suggests that speculation over Ethereum prices is likely to rise and increase demand similarly to that for Bitcoin ETFs over the last several months.

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/solana-next-bitcoin-210609387.html,Is Solana the Next Bitcoin?,"Cryptocurrencies have long puzzled traditional stock analysts. How can an asset class with no earnings, dividends, or fundamental value be worth anything more than zero?

Yet here we are. Bitcoin (BTC-USD) is worth almost $1 trillion. $75 million worth of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) trade hands daily. Even “meme” coins are returning. Speculators are naturally drawn to rising prices, and their buying pressure often sends prices even higher, regardless of the fundamentals.


Today, a new cryptocurrency has captured speculator interest. Since October, prices of Solana (SOL-USD) have risen from the $20 range to nearly $100, making it one of the best-performing large-cap cryptos on the market. The FTX scandal that plagued Solana is fading from the market’s collective memory, and the high-quality cryptocurrency continues to hold an impressive technological lead over rivals.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

Could Solana, therefore, become the next Bitcoin?

Solana Prices: Using Technical Analysis
To answer this, I turn to technical analysis — the use of pricing and other data to determine investor sentiment.

We know from history that technical analysis can work in certain circumstances. Many high-risk moonshot companies (similarly with no earnings, dividends, or fundamental worth) follow predictable patterns that technical analysis strategies can exploit. And machine learning can also be used to sniff out patterns with startling efficiency. (In that particular study, I show how neural networks can pick out Bitcoin trades that return 25% on average!)

Fortunately, you don’t need a degree in data science to find patterns that work. You only need to know the tools and assets you’re working with.

Consider Bitcoin, a coin that typically “breaks out” when investor interest is high, and then flatlines when it fades from headlines. Here, I’ll use a MACD Crossover Strategy — a technical strategy particularly good at finding “breakouts” while ignoring sideways movements.

As you might expect, the MACD strategy does exceptionally well on Bitcoin. Since 2013, the system has returned four times more than a buy-and-hold strategy, even without short positions. (The flat orange lines represent times where the strategy sells its Bitcoin and holds cash).


The same is true for Solana. Though the MACD system failed to capture all of Solana’s upside during the 2021 crypto craze, it was enough to outperform the buy-and-hold strategy over the long run. The MACD system would have sold Solana in December 2021 (represented by the flatlining orange line) and kept investors mostly on the sidelines to come out far ahead.


What Does Technical Analysis Say About Solana Today?
Since October, the MACD indicator has been decidedly bullish on Solana. The MACD line (blue) remains above zero, and the gap between the MACD line (blue) and signal line (red) remains greater than the 0.015 threshold. This gap is important to avoid sideways trading.


That tells us that markets remain bullish about Solana’s prospects. The cryptocurrency has only traded above its current level 31% of the time, once you adjust for prices. And history tells us that the MACD line is a strong predictor of future gains.

However, astute readers will notice that the MACD “strength” has dropped off since peaking in December. Prices have begun to cool off in recent weeks. And using the same graph for Bitcoin shows that the world’s largest cryptocurrency has rebounded more strongly than its smaller rival.


Together, that tells us that markets believe Solana is still not Bitcoin. Bitcoin remains far ahead, both in consumer adoption and potential regulation, and its rising prices reflect that sentiment. If you had to buy just one crypto, it should probably be Bitcoin.

What’s Next for Solana?
History tells us that Solana remains a “buy” at current prices. The cryptocurrency’s strong fourth quarter means its MACD signal remains above zero. And investor interest remains high; traded volumes in the past week remain 7 times higher than the average in 2023.

Solana saw a similar pattern emerge in September 2021, when the cryptocurrency’s MACD line dropped from 30 to 1.9 before accelerating back to 22. (Its price would rise from $164 to $220 during that reaccelerating period).

But even in 2021, Solana’s second surge was far smaller than its first. When asset prices are high, it takes far more fresh money to send values even higher.

This time around looks no different. Prices of Solana have already risen 5X since October, and Solana’s sagging MACD figure comes even as excitement over Bitcoin ETFs is rising.

In 2021, I recommended investors buy $500 of Dogecoin (DOGE-USD) to experience the meme mania firsthand. Prices of Dogecoin would eventually rise fivefold on extreme investor interest. This time around, however, I’m urging far more caution. Though the technicals suggest that Solana will grind higher, investors should still remember that it pays to wait for the best opportunities.",Solana

With multiple catalysts on the horizon, from increased institutional adoption to innovations in blockchain technology, there is no better time to build positions in high-quality cryptocurrencies.

I believe the smartest way to approach this space is to establish positions in larger, safer cryptocurrencies before venturing into more speculative small-cap assets. This strategy allows investors to benefit from the rising tide that lifts all boats, while minimizing downside risk. Before chasing the next hot altcoin, it’s wise to anchor your portfolio around the cryptocurrencies that are most likely to stand the test of time.

Kicking off the new year, Bitcoin (BTC-USD) has reaffirmed its dominance as the market leader after rallying past the key psychological $45,000 threshold. Make no mistake about it – despite the fancy buzzwords thrown around in crypto these days, Bitcoin remains the gold standard for a reason. Without smart contracts or a marketing team selling you on pipe dreams, Bitcoin continues its gradual, inexorable climb over the long term, driven by its unyielding supply and demand economics encoded into its very core.

Here’s another reason why you need Bitcoin exposure in 2024. In approximately four months, it’s anticipated there will be another halving event that will slash Bitcoin mining rewards in half overnight. This supply shock should stoke Bitcoin prices, assuming demand for this digital asset continues on its long-term trajectory. Pair this with swelling institutional interest and the rising probability of a spot Bitcoin ETF approval, and capital gains are likely. The token’s spectacular recovery from recent lows could merely be a preview of what’s to come in 2024.

Yet, Bitcoin’s biggest edge is its staying power. Crises and crashes have come and gone, yet Bitcoin is more battle-tested than ever. When the music stops for lesser-known cryptos, Bitcoin will keep dancing to its beat, driven by fundamentals rather than hype. Buying Bitcoin remains one of the soundest ways to gain crypto exposure over a long time horizon.

Ethereum (ETH-USD)

As the second-largest blockchain project, Ethereum (ETH-USD) builds upon Bitcoin’s foundations by incorporating smart contract functionality, allowing for a vastly expanded range of potential applications. After transitioning to a more energy-efficient proof-of-stake consensus mechanism in 2022, Ethereum appears poised to maintain its advantage as the most secure and stable blockchain for decentralized applications and services.

Ethereum powers much of the flashy Web 3.0 world – NFTs, Metaverse platforms, DeFi protocols, and more. As crypto adoption advances in 2024, Ethereum is well-positioned to capture value from surging activity across its burgeoning ecosystem. And with an ambitious roadmap focused around scalability and security upgrades on the horizon, Ethereum’s development shows no signs of slowing. That’s impressive, when one considers its commanding lead in the Web 3.0 space.

While recently lagging Bitcoin in terms of returns, Ethereum has vastly outpaced Bitcoin in every bull market since its inception. I think that trend could continue if more smart contract use cases are found.

Solana (SOL-USD)

Solana (SOL-USD) offers more concentrated upside, as it is more speculative. As an Ethereum competitor, Solana’s blockchain activity has surged alongside the increasing adoption of fast, low-cost NFT minting and DeFi applications.

Solana’s traction in Web 3.0 means its potential volume could overwhelm larger rivals. Like broadband cables, existing networks can choke with overuse. If Ethereum gets clogged in 2024’s bull market rally, developers and liquidity could readily migrate to faster alternatives like Solana.

Admittedly, by compromising decentralization for speed, Solana’s frequent outages are quite concerning. But I don’t think a project of this size will ever permanently go down. It is not a bad pick if you seek high-upside exposure with manageable risk.",Solana
https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-cryptos-watch-sector-becomes-212612777.html,7 Cryptos to Watch as the Sector Becomes Irrationally Rational,"If you want to know where cryptos may be headed in 2024 and beyond, just look at Generation Z. While I hesitate to focus on any one metric for any investment class, the underlying cryptocurrency market simply doesn’t respond to rational considerations. It appears utterly irrational until you realize the power of the underlying demographic catalyst.

Unlike other asset classes, cryptos represent a decentralized paradigm shift. It’s a purely digital ecosystem, carrying no real connection to the physical world. In other words, you don’t hold certificates of crypto unit ownership in your hands. Rather, your wealth is represented in the binary code of digitalization. And that suits Gen Z just fine. After all, they have no real recollection of the analog past.


Therefore, it only makes sense that the zoomers’ investment of choice is cryptos. Even better, the stiff suits on Wall Street recognize the paradigm shift awaiting them. As Gallup mentioned, the economic boom of the 1980s and 1990s handsomely rewarded the baby boomers.  The same might be said about the digital asset boom for the zoomers.

Here’s the best part. You don’t have to be a zoomer to participate. Below are key cryptos to watch.

Bitcoin (BTC-USD)

Under “traditional” assessments of Bitcoin (BTC-USD), one might conclude that both BTC and other cryptos are due for a pullback. According to TipRanks’ on-chain analysis, Bitcoin comes in as “mostly bearish.” In particular, the underlying blockchain’s net network growth landed at only 0.24%, a pessimistic signal relative to historical norms.

Also, large transactions – a momentum indicator focused on transactions greater than $100,000 – dipped 3.15%. That might signal lower participation among the whales or the biggest stakeholders of a particular virtual currency. If you want to look at the technical picture, Bitcoin continues to rise higher against fading acquisition volume. Ordinarily, you want rising volume to confirm a rising price action. That’s not happening here.

It might not matter. Over the past 24 hours from early morning Tuesday, BTC gained nearly 7% of market value. Regaining firm command of the $45,000 price level, 50K may not be too far away. Frankly, I don’t know where this money is coming from. All I can say is that Gen Z wants what it wants.

My idea? Don’t fight the tape.

Ethereum (ETH-USD)

Again, under a traditional assessment, Ethereum (ETH-USD) might not be much of a confidence-boost. Sure, its on-chain analysis suggests a “mostly neutral” backdrop. However, that’s not necessarily a riveting description, especially when you’re talking about one of the most exciting cryptos. Plus, some of these metrics are rather poor.

For example, TipRanks notes that Ethereum’s net network growth sits at 0.23%. That’s bearish compared to prior norms. Also, large transactions account for 0.57% of value exchanges in the underlying blockchain. That’s a lot better than Bitcoin obviously but it’s another bearish signal against historical standards. And yes, while Ethereum marches higher, acquisition volume has been slipping. That’s just not a great look in any other context.

However, we’re talking about decentralized digital assets. In the trailing 24 hours, ETH gained over 4%. And in the past seven days, the number two crypto by market capitalization swung up roughly 7%. Looking ahead, I’ve got to imagine that the $3,000 level will soon be in sight. As with Bitcoin, don’t fight the tape.

Tether (USDT-USD)

As a stablecoin or crypto asset pegged to a hard currency (usually the U.S. dollar), Tether (USDT-USD) lacks the impetus if you will of most other virtual currencies. Rather than the buy-low, sell-high directive, Tether enables investors to effectively store their wealth in the blockchain. So, when opportunities arise, investors can simply respond by trading Tethers for whatever cryptos they’re targeting.

Still, in many ways, it’s a high-risk, high-reward proposition. For example, Tether’s website clarifies any misconceptions about its USDT units. They represent digital tokens and are not legal tender. So, don’t bother the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC); they’re not interested in your sob story. Thus, investors expose their wealth to USDT at their own risk. If a digital bank run materializes, you are SOL as the kids like to say.

Subsequently, whether Tether falls below or above its 1:1 peg with the dollar may be symbolic of confidence in the crypto sector. In the trailing one-week period, USDT has mostly traded at or above parity with the greenback. In my opinion, that’s a solidly positive signal for blockchain assets.

Solana (SOL-USD)

Throughout 2022 and much of 2023, questions plagued Solana (SOL-USD). To make a long story short, Solana represents a quicker, more scalable and more accessible – due to lower fees – version of Ethereum. Unsurprisingly, many folks labeled it one of the Ethereum killers. However, the downcycle of cryptos (brought on in part by spiked interest rates) imposed a beating on SOL.

Another factor that clouded Solana – though through no fault of its own – was that it earlier enjoyed the backing of the disgraced Sam Bankman-Fried. Call it guilt by association. However, during the so-called “Uptober” seasonal cycle of cryptos, Solana absolutely skyrocketed. And aside from the normal ebb and flow – and the occasional sharp hiccup – SOL continues to march northward.

It’s hard to argue with the data. Just in the past 24 hours, SOL returned stakeholders more than 11% of market value. As of this writing, that makes it one of the best-performing decentralized assets among the top 10 by market cap.

Looking to the next few weeks, FXLeaders suggests that $160 may be a profit-taking point. Below $120, you still have a scalping opportunity here.

XRP (XRP-USD)

One of the most popular altcoins or alternative cryptos, XRP (XRP-USD) initially started off with a bit of controversy. Founded by Ripple Labs, debate among public forums materialized about whether XRP was truly decentralized or not. However, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) targeted Ripple for a lawsuit alleging securities violations. Suddenly, it seemed as if the entire crypto community rallied around Ripple.

As you know if you follow the blockchain ecosystem, a favorable federal ruling bolstered sentiment for XRP. Almost immediately, the altcoin went vertically skyward. However, with the regulatory agency unwilling to let the ruling stand as is, XRP started to fade. Still, during the Uptober catalyst, XRP found its mojo again. Personally, I think investors should be able to trust the digital asset over the long haul.

From a fundamental perspective, the crypto cat’s out of the bag. On technical grounds, XRP has generally printed a series of higher lows since the summer of 2022. Barring some unforeseen catastrophic event, XRP’s kinetic energy should sustain.

Cardano (ADA-USD)

Another popular altcoin, Cardano (ADA-USD) enjoyed one of the greatest paradigm shifts in the virtual currency sphere in 2023. For most of last year, ADA languished, either slipping sharply relative to other blockchain assets or mired in sideways trading while other coins and tokens shot higher. However, circumstances changed for the better – a lot better – during Uptober.

Adding to the enthusiasm, Cardano continues to impress onlookers. Over the trailing 24 hours, ADA gained nearly 5% of market value. In the past week, it swung up a little over 4%. At the moment, the crypto coin trades hands for around 63 cents. Just a month ago, you could have bought Cardano for less than 40 cents.

Still, while ADA has already benefited from a significant surge, it’s still possible to scalp some upside from here. Recall that earlier in 2023, some experts called for Cardano to retest the $1 level. In hindsight, of course, that didn’t quite materialize. However, with cryptos enjoying newfound vigor, a buck in ’04 seems a very reasonable target.

Avalanche (AVAX-USD)

One of the other top-performing cryptos ranked among the top 10 by market cap, Avalanche (AVAX-USD) strongly benefited from the recent sentiment pivot in the blockchain. Right now, AVAX trades hands at just over $43. That translates to a 24-hour performance of nearly 12% up. Currently, the total value of the network stands at just under $15.8 billion, good enough for ninth place.

Billed as a layer one blockchain, Avalanche provides a base layer for applications and transactions. Basically, it acts as a foundational infrastructure upon which other applications are built. Specifically, Avalanche seeks to provide a platform for custom blockchain networks. In doing so, it aims to unseat Ethereum, thus representing one of the viable Ethereum killers.

Interestingly, AVAX prints “mostly bearish” on-chain signals, according to TipRanks. In particular, large transaction volume slipped 1.78%, which presents a pessimistic look. However, with 73% of individual unit holders in the money at the time-of-writing price, enthusiasm for Avalanche runs strong.

Looking ahead, the bulls may look to bring AVAX up to $80, the next logical upside target.",Solana
https://finance.yahoo.com/news/top-7-cryptos-buy-off-110000813.html,The Top 7 Cryptos to Buy Before They Take Off Next Year,"The cryptocurrency winds have shifted — after a long crypto winter, the market is thawing out. Many top cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC-USD) and Ethereum (ETH-USD) have seen strong gains recently as investor sentiment turns bullish again. With 2024 less than a week away, now is the perfect time to take positions in cryptos before the next bull run kicks into high gear.

In this article, I’ll be focusing on bigger market-cap coins instead of the small-cap gems I usually cover. While those microcap altcoins can provide exciting returns, they should only ever make up a tiny portion of your crypto allocation. The majority belongs to proven large-cap coins with real-world utility. As many new investors enter the crypto space, I want to focus on projects that balance significant upside potential with lower risk profiles.


Over the next year, several key developments could act as catalysts to send top cryptocurrencies soaring to new all-time highs. Upgrades to major blockchain networks, increasing real-world adoption, and growing Wall Street interest are just some of the drivers that could stoke major bull runs across crypto assets, old and new alike. By investing now, savvy holders position themselves advantageously to ride the next upward wave. Let’s take a closer look!

Bitcoin (BTC-USD)

As the original cryptocurrency, Bitcoin has always been my number-one pick leading up to any potential bull market. With its capped supply of 21 million and deflationary properties, BTC simply has the best risk-to-reward profile for long-term crypto investing. Several vital developments make 2024 an especially exciting year for Bitcoin.

First, we could finally see the approval of a Bitcoin ETF in the U.S. Allowing the public stock market to invest in BTC would be an absolute game-changer in terms of mainstream adoption. Wall Street and retail investors could gain exposure without holding crypto directly. Given the surging interest in Bitcoin, an ETF could attract a tidal wave of capital inflows.

Additionally, 2024 brings Bitcoin’s next halving event. By slashing the block rewards in half, supply tightens dramatically while demand continues increasing exponentially. Previous halvings catalyzed massive bull runs, and I expect 2024s to do the same. With the Fed forecasted to reverse course and cut rates within the next 12 months, the stage is set for Bitcoin to potentially eclipse its former all-time highs.

Ethereum (ETH-USD)

While Bitcoin takes the top spot for its digital gold narrative, Ethereum earns its place as my number two crypto pick for its unrivaled utility. What Bitcoin lacks in functionality, Ethereum provides.

As the home of smart contracts and Web 3.0 development, hundreds of projects are built on Ethereum’s backbone. Use cases span decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), metaverse worlds and far beyond. Real-world adoption continues to accelerate as both startups and enterprises launch Ethereum-based applications.

With ambitious network upgrades in the works, Ethereum is set on dramatically improving speed and scalability. Though it may never reach the efficiency of lower-cost blockchains, Ethereum compensates by being the most feature-rich and time-tested option. Hype invariably concentrates around Ethereum ecosystem coins. We saw this vividly early last year as meme coins, DeFi tokens and NFT plays erupted. As the next bull run ignites, Ethereum’s thriving ecosystem should drive an upside that significantly outpaces Bitcoin.

Solana (SOL-USD)

Dubbed an “Ethereum killer,” Solana (SOL-USD) earns the third spot on my list for its composable approach to Web 3.0 infrastructure. With decentralized app development surging, Solana presents a high-performance alternative to Ethereum.

Solana boasts 50,000 transactions per second at rock-bottom fees and has raw speed and scalability that outpaces its rivals. Costing just a fraction of a penny per transaction, developers save tremendously building on Solana compared to Ethereum. This powerful value proposition makes SOL a go-to blockchain for launching new products and services.

Nevertheless, Solana’s Achilles’ heel lies in its lingering stability issues. Network outages last year tarnished trust in Solana’s robustness. Rival blockchains have had far fewer service disruptions historically. Investors want reliability during peak congestion periods before investing more in Solana.

Still, should Ethereum get overloaded with demand again amidst the next bull frenzy, hungry developers may migrate en masse to Solana. Its throughput potential remains unmatched while keeping fees dirt cheap. These strengths could drive SOL to new highs as users prioritize speed and cost over decentralization concerns. For risk-tolerant traders, Solana offers exciting upside.

Avalanche (AVAX-USD)

As congestion throttles Ethereum and Solana during peak demand, developers often turn to Avalanche (AVAX-USD) for its speed and low fees. Clocking over 4,500 transactions per second (over 143,000 in a recent testnet breakthrough) with sub-second finality, AVAX can handle immense throughput. Transaction fees average a tiny fraction of a penny, saving builders tremendous overhead costs.

Avalanche endured some hiccups tied to a system bug last year, sparking concerns over the network’s reliability. However, the core protocol appears sturdy now, and significant upgrades should reinforce resilience and security. With abundant room for expanding its burgeoning DeFi, NFT, and blockchain gaming activity, Avalanche looks ready to capture excess demand.

Render Token (RNDR-USD)

As AI proliferation accelerates, crypto projects enabling machine learning hold great appeal. Render Token (RNDR-USD) and its GPU compute network present a clever solution – decentralizing the power-hungry rendering required for 3D graphics and video projects.

By tapping idle GPU resources of network participants, Render offers a much cheaper alternative to centralized cloud services. Render Node operators earn RNDR for contributing hardware, while developers/companies save cash on intensive rendering jobs. It’s a win-win system with a huge TAM among visual effects and CAD design firms.

With over 2.36 million frames rendered in Q3 and surging monthly demand, Render’s real-world utility is gaining strong traction. As profits flow to node operators, additional devices should come online, strengthening the network. This virtuous cycle effect means Render can scale efficiently to meet the rendering needs of multi-billion dollar industries like gaming/metaverse and automotive design.

If you believe in the mass growth of AI, big data, IoT and other burgeoning technologies, Render Token seems like a great bet.

Dubbed the “Solana Killer,” this project offers blistering speed and high throughput like its eponymous rival. But unlike Solana, Aleph Zero (AZERO-USD) prioritizes reliability — helping partially rectify blockchain’s trilemma dilemma. Its novel design facilitates ~100,000 transactions per second and sub-second finality. However, it does still lack decentralization as it only has 131 validators.

As rising gas fees induce developer frustration on Ethereum again, Aleph Zero stands ready to capture disillusioned builders. It contains almost everything developers need — an EVM optimizer to port Ethereum dApps easily, SDKs for coding dApps in various languages, NFT-minting functionality and more. The network even offers access to other ecosystems via bridges.

While risks exist until tangible adoption materializes, Aleph Zero appears greatly undervalued relative to its vast long-term potential. If Solana instability resurfaces or Ethereum congestion boils over, expect Aleph Zero to post outsized gains as the premier alternative for Web 3.0 development.

Polygon (MATIC-USD)

As interest surrounding Ethereum’s scaling solutions intensifies, Polygon (MATIC-USD) remains the pacesetter. Instead of handling transactions off-chain, Polygon shards Ethereum to bolster speed and reduce fees substantially while retaining security.

Unlike rivals, Polygon’s standout advantage is its zkEVM tech, which allows Ethereum developers to port dApps to Polygon with almost no code changes. Imagine instantly upgrading your Ethereum dApp to handle significantly more transactions with 90% cheaper fees — that’s the proposition Polygon delivers.

With several high-profile partnerships and thousands of dApps migrated onto its network, Polygon continues cementing its status as Ethereum’s go-to layer-2. As Ethereum upgrades progress but likely fail to solve congestion and cost issues fully, demand for solutions like Polygon will only amplify through the next bull market.",Solana
https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-cryptos-watch-beckons-020442004.html,7 Cryptos to Watch as the New Year Beckons,"According to a recent op-ed from Bloomberg, it’s been a happy holiday for cryptos to watch and their loyal advocates. In particular, the benchmark virtual currency soared this year, a dynamic that many in the mainstream did not see coming. Per author Brooke Sample, the optimism largely centers on the flexibility of financial technology (fintech) platforms.

That’s a valid point and one that helps open access to cryptos to watch across the world. However, what may be the pivotal catalyst for the blockchain ecosystem is demographic realities. Back during the 1980s and 1990s, many baby boomers bolstered their wealth through the equities market because that was when they entered their prime earning years.


By logical deduction, the same catalyst could materialize but for cryptos to watch. Millennials have certainly expanded their earning power. And many of the oldest members of Generation Z have entered the workforce. More than likely, they’re going to invest in what they know and love.

That’s cryptos, my friends. Subsequently, the virtual currency sector could see significant gains in 2024, warranting a closer examination of the below digital assets.

Bitcoin (BTC-USD)

What it is: Launched in 2009, Bitcoin (BTC-USD) is the original digital currency. Fundamentally, the underlying peer-to-peer technology facilitated instant payments. Not only that, the mechanism forwarded “trustless” transactions or exchanges of wealth that required no centralized intermediary.

Relevance: Over the past few months, anticipation has built regarding a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF). Intriguingly, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) set forth a deadline of Dec. 29 for ETF applications to finalize their filings, according to a Cointelegraph article. Another potential catalyst for BTC is a halving event expected in April 2024. Basically, the event will reduce miners’ rewards for validating blockchain transactions, thus better ensuring BTC’s scarcity.

Pros: Currently, BTC enjoys a strong technical posture, with the price noticeably above its 50-day moving average. Also, the nearer-term average runs well above the 200 DMA (which sits at around $31,500).

Cons: Since October, acquisition volume of BTC has been slipping, which is not what you want to see. Instead, you’d like rising volume to confirm a rally.

Ethereum (ETH-USD)

What it is: Billed as an alternative peer-to-peer network, Ethereum (ETH-USD) enables the transfer of digital assets directly with other people. Put another way, we’re talking about trustless transactions. More importantly, Ethereum forwarded the concept of smart contracts, or the ability to coordinate and make agreements via trustless platforms.

Relevance: As with Bitcoin, much anticipation exists regarding a possible spot Ethereum ETF. However, according to another Cointelegraph article, the US SEC is pushing back its decision on several ETH funds to May of next year. That’s not exactly surprising that presumably, Bitcoin will be the first of the cryptos to watch to enjoy a spot ETF. With the complexities involved with the underlying smart contract mechanism – not to mention the proof-of-stake protocol – an Ethereum fund brings additional complexities.

Pros: ETH presents a solid technical profile, though it’s choppier compared to BTC. Notably, Ethereum continues to run above its 50 DMA, which is well above the 200 DMA.

Cons: A common concern among many cryptos to watch is, acquisition volume has been fading, in this case since November.

Tether (USDT-USD)

What it is: A stablecoin, Tether (USDT-USD) operates under a different “ethos” than most other cryptos to watch. Because Tether is pegged on a one-to-one basis with the dollar, the point here isn’t about extracting capital gains. Rather, by storing wealth in the blockchain medium, crypto investors can respond immediately to new opportunities.

Relevance: Let’s face it – with cryptos, people are interested in attaining massive wealth in the shortest time possible. Achieving a peg to the dollar doesn’t exactly sound like a path to riches. However, one can extract significant insights into the blockchain ecosystem by assessing the value of the peg relative to the greenback. Notably, in the trailing one-week period (through early Tuesday morning), USDT has spent most of its time above the 1:1 ratio.",Solana

JARED BLIKRE: As the markets price in rate cuts into the new year, those in crypto are betting big money on a spot Bitcoin ETF and it becoming a reality as the SEC gives companies a new deadline of December 29 to make final changes to their applications. The new deadline has led many industry watchers to predict a wave of approvals come January, but not necessarily news there. Bitcoin is now trading above $42,000, reaching levels this month we haven't seen since April of 2022.

And for his take on what is coming next for crypto, let's bring in Laurence Latimer, the co-founder and CEO of Dinara, a crypto-trading platform. Laurence, thank you for coming in here today. So what is the importance of this spot Bitcoin ETF? I've been tracking this for months. I've been seeing the enthusiasm. But I guess the big question is when we get this finally maybe on January 10, is it a sell-the-news event?

LAURENCE LATIMER: Yeah, and I thank you for having me. First of all, as we come down to thinking about what's happening for the Bitcoin approvals-- Bitcoin ETF approvals, the reality is much of the enthusiasm, as you just said, much of the attention has-- and much of the price movement has largely been priced in. That's what we think here at Dinara, and that's certainly what we believe.

It's going to be a massive event for the industry. The work that's gone into that from some of the largest firms in the industry has been happening over two-- some of them over two years. So it is a really massive event. It's a great sort of support for the institutionalization of digital assets and the mainstreaming of digital assets, widespread adoption. But we do think there's maybe a little bit of frothiness there and that the kind of price movement that many are expecting to see may already be mostly priced in.

BRAD SMITH: And so with that in mind, do you think about the perhaps tail, the longer tail of it? We'll see a jump, perhaps, early on in inflows into some of these ETFs, but then what after that? What is perhaps a good baseline for us to consider looking at the amount of flows that actually make their way into one of the riskier parts of the asset classes out there?

LAURENCE LATIMER: Yeah, well, you know, we made some predictions for 2024, and so this sort of falls firmly in the space there. We think that there's going to be some real meaningful appreciation across the whole industry. In October, the overall market cap for digital assets sat at around $1 trillion. It's now about $1.6 trillion. We think by the end of 2025, you'll be sitting at about $2.5 trillion in overall market cap. So if you kind of averaged that across the industry, we think there's another 50% or so upside built into the, you know, pricing of all assets. We think Bitcoin's among them.

What we'll see is that ETF demand that's created there will put a nice floor and support for price movement. We also think there's some optimism around the legislative front. We hope to see some thoughtful legislative action at some point in 2024 as well. That will, again, put some upward pressure.

And then you have Bitcoin halving, which is a technical piece that's happening, I believe, in April. And that traditionally has also put some upward pressure on the price of the asset.

Leading assets including Bitcoin (BTC-USD) and Ethereum (ETH-USD) continue to make a lot of sense in the lead up to 2024.

Internet Computer(ICP-USD) Is among all coins to avoid at all costs. The company has made sustained efforts to develop a smart contracts platform that ostensibly can challenge Ethereum.

The cryptocurrency market remains acutely aware of the fact that ethereum is far from infallible. It’s expensive, it isn’t that fast, and any project that can improve on those factors has a chance. In fact, that’s been the springboard for many leading names, for example, Solana (SOL-USD).

Internet Computer has lost a lot of value over its short life. The company received early investment from leading VCs including Andreessen Horowitz. That was enough to set off frenzied speculation that hasn’t panned out. In the interim investors have seen the value of Internet Computer continue to slide overall and intermittently spike. Those intermittent spikes have done nothing to quell its continued decline and investors should absolutely stay away.

There’s nothing to suggest that it won’t continue to disappoint investors.

Shiba Inu (SHIB-USD) serves more as a test case for what can go right when investing in altcoins but today isn’t really worth anything.

Let me correct myself, Shiba Inu was never truly worth anything. Its lack of inherent value stems from its lack of utility. However, when the price of an asset moves from a fraction of a penny with seven zeros to the right of the decimal point to a fraction of a penny with four zeros to the right of the decimal point, there’s a lot of money to be made.

That’s the story of Shiba Inu. it was designed to compete with Dogecoin (DOGE-USD), which doesn’t really mean anything at all. Instead, it was a clever marketing ploy that was successful in that it drummed up demand. There’s clearly a reason why this is one of the cryptos I wouldn’t touch.

Shiba Inu has undoubtedly broken a lot of hearts across the cryptocurrency investing space since its initial explosion onto the public consciousness. it doesn’t have any utility and so there’s no realistic reason for people to be investing in it today.

Pepe (PEPE-USD) is very much like Shiba Inu and Dogecoin. All of these projects are designed to take advantage of the unique evolution of the internet. Their success piggybacks on the success of memes and their unique nature.

Pepe is another one of the so-called meme coins that has provided ultra-fast, ultra profitable returns, making a name for itself in the process.

Then, just as predictably, has suffered the slow decline in value that is very characteristic of meme coins overall. Congratulations to those who were fortunate enough to invest in Pepe prior to its take off. I certainly hold no grudge against them and understand that speculation and risk are part of investing in general.

Some of them have reaped incredible rewards for taking on such risks. At the same time, I think Pepe has entered a predictable stage of life that means cryptos go through. investors can purchase Pepe now and there’s a chance that they can see intraday spikes of 10% or 20% on their investment, and maybe that’s enough. However, I don’t think that’s why people invest in Pepe. instead, they are hoping for it to explode again which simply doesn’t happen twice. meme coins like Pepe can sometimes turn $1,000 into a $1 million overnight, but once they do, don’t expect it to happen again.",Solana
https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-moonshot-web3-cryptos-buy-100000802.html,3 Moonshot Web3 Cryptos to Buy Before They Takeoff,"As Bitcoin (BTC-USD) has started to cool in recent weeks, many altcoins are just starting to catch fire. Investors tend to move profits from the major Web3 cryptos into higher potential plays as bull markets mature. There are tons of innovative Web 3.0 projects with vast upside that haven’t gotten their time in the spotlight yet. If you do your homework, buying into the right ones early could pay off big time.

I’ll highlight three lesser-known cryptos taking novel approaches to realizing the promise of Web 3.0. These projects have flown under the radar but have major catalysts on the horizon that could drive exponential growth. They obviously aren’t sure bets, but the potential upside more than justifies the risks if you invest responsibly. Let’s take a look!

Kaspa (KAS-USD)

I recommended Kaspa (KAS-USD) during its summer dip this year and believe you should consider buying during the current downturn, too. Kaspa has been one of the top performers this year and is now a top 50 coin. It uses the “GHOSTDAG” protocol to deliver exceptional performance compared to other Web 3.0 blockchains, and developers claim the protocol essentially solves the blockchain trilemma as it apparently does not sacrifice speed, security, or decentralization.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

I definitely have high hopes for this blockchain, as it could see a sizable inflow of developers and users in the next crypto bull run once other Web 3.0 blockchains start to become congested. Once that happens, whether or not this new protocol can deal with a high volume of users will indeed be seen. Newcomers like Avalanche (AVAX-USD) and Solana (SOL-USD) have had huge problems dealing with a high volume of users, and if Kaspa proves itself, it could be a top 10 coin.

SmarDex (SDEX-USD)

SmarDex (SDEX-USD) offers a promising new decentralized exchange built for maximum capital efficiency. With a modest $89 million market cap, SDEX flies under the radar but packs seriously disruptive potential. As the DeFi space heats up, inferior DEXs with clunky interfaces and subpar yields will lose ground to superior competition. SmarDex aims straight for the jugular of leading DEX Uniswap (UNI-USD) with a slick platform optimized for yield generation.

The dilution here looks favorable for early adopters relative to other DeFi plays. SmarDex innovates a revolutionary open-source automated market maker, allowing users to profit from both impermanent loss reduction and impermanent gain generation. By some accounts, it already facilitates the most efficient swaps in crypto, occasionally even making you money on the exchange itself. The automated aggregator model appears poised to attract liquidity and volume during the next industry run-up.

Once word spreads in the yield-hungry DeFi community, SmarDex looks primed for a surge of capital inflows. Competitive staking opportunities should drive significant user adoption following the next altcoin rally. With market leadership for DEX interfaces and farming efficiency potentially within reach, 500%+ returns on a future $89 million coin seem plausible over the coming years. Of course, with nascent small caps, investing prudently is mandatory. But as a high-risk, high-reward DeFi pick, SDEX offers blockbuster upside for early birds willing to speculate here.

Radix (XRD-USD)

Radix (XRD-USD) is an off-the-radar layer-1 protocol tackling one of crypto’s greatest roadblocks – accessible mainstream application development. Radix’s DeFi and dApp ecosystem has rapidly grown since launching smart contracts a few months ago that abstracts away blockchain complexities.

Beyond development, Radix focuses intensely on normalized end-user experiences, providing a mobile wallet, deeply integrated into the ledger, which facilitates better user interaction with the apps. Streamlining these initial touchpoints can spur further decentralized adoption among the mainstream audiences necessary for the next growth wave.

The recent collaboration with Supra Oracles and NOWNodes marks a transformational milestone for Radix. Supra Oracles, with its extensive network, strengthens Radix with reliable data streams, which is critical for both developers and users. Simultaneously, the partnership with NOWNodes opens up seamless access to full Radix RPC nodes, simplifying access for many developers and projects.

These partnerships also validate Radix’s budding network, and financial institutions have taken note – for example, Radix recently demonstrated core functionalities to an interested major bank’s blockchain division. All this for a sub-$500 million market cap seems very appealing to me.",Solana

It is becoming more entrenched in global financial systems and normalized in the process. This normalization has led to this list of cryptos to buy to December.

The cryptocurrency space continues to be dominated by leading names, including Bitcoin (BTC-USD) and Ethereum (ETH-USD). They will continue to dominate the market in 2024, and as they move, so will altcoins.


Growth is returning, manifesting as continued Capital inflows into the cryptocurrency market. The current market cap is above $1.6 trillion after beginning 2023 at just over $800 billion. There is plenty of room left to grow, given that the market cap reached 2.8 trillion in late 2021.

Bitcoin (BTC-USD) Has risen sharply throughout 2023, which might dissuade some investors from considering purchasing at this point. However, that’s a bad idea.

Everyone is aware of spot Bitcoin ETFs and their likelihood of becoming a reality in 2024. Bitcoin ETFs, or a near certainty at this point, will further normalize the wider adoption of cryptocurrency into the overarching financial system.

Thus, that’s why I and many other people remain bullish on Bitcoin even as it has passed the $40,000 mark. Remember, Bitcoin rose above $60,000 in 2021. It has since become more normalized, making the investment case that much easier overall.

Bitcoin also remains by far the most important cryptocurrency and dominates the space. As it goes, so goes everything else in the space. If you believe that cryptocurrency is going to continue to rise in value in 2024 due to lower interest rates, then you have to consider that Bitcoin must be one of those cryptos to buy.

Hedera (HBAR-USD)

Hedera (HBAR-USD) is a great position heading into 2024 as cryptocurrency continues to become more and more normalized. It is known as the leading enterprise use case cryptocurrency that will matter more.

The company lays out a bunch of reasons for which enterprises should consider using it on its website. Those reasons include fraud detection and mitigation, asset tokenization, and permissioned blockchain development.

It’s easy to assume that more and more Enterprises will be considering blockchain and cryptocurrency as cryptocurrency further integrates. Hedera has already carved out a strong position there, which will benefit the company in 2024.

Speaking of becoming increasingly integrated into the dominant financial networks, Hedera is one of a handful of cryptocurrencies that currently have ISO 20222 compliance. ISO 20222 compliance is a standard for global interoperability of payment systems and is broadly related to banking standards such as SWIFT. Investors should expect that a Hedera will soon be fully interoperable on global standards at scale.

Solana (SOL-USD)

Solana (SOL-USD) rose to fame as an alternative to Ethereum. Solana continues to make strides in that direction. Investment in the project has skyrocketed in 2023 after falling precipitously in 2022.

Even though Solana has risen from $10 to above $70 in late 2023, there’s plenty of room left to grow. Solana traded at more than $235 in late 2021 before the Federal Reserve jacked up rates. All indications are that great hikes are over. We are at peak rates, and everyone is anticipating rate cuts in 2024. Of course, that sets up a situation where Solana and everything else predicated upon growth can run much higher.

Investors have long been interested in Solana because they believe it is more price-effective and efficient than Ethereum. Cathie Wood applauded Solana for those characteristics in mid-November. She has developed a reputation for spotting innovative growth, and she’s not the only one who believes in Solana now.",Solana

Solana professes to be able to settle transactions faster and at a fraction of the cost compared to the Ethereum network. However, analysts argue that the former achieves this by compromising some of its overall security.

The latest indications on the CME Group’s FedWatch gauge show a 100% probability that the Fed will maintain its target rate within the current range of 5.25% to 5.50% at its next meetings. The Federal Reserve Open Market Committee (FOMC) is set to announce the US central bank's next monetary policy decision at a meeting on December 13.

Driven by recent indications that both consumer and wholesale inflation rates have eased considerably from their mid-2022 peaks, data on the CME Group’s FedWatch also points to a full percentage point of rate cuts by the end of 2024.

Analysts point to signals the Fed may be softening its overall ambition to reach an annual inflation goal of 2%. “What we decided to do is maintain a policy rate and await further data. We want to see convincing evidence, really, that we have reached the appropriate level,” Fed Chair Jerome Powell said at his post-meeting news conference in September.

According to data to Artemix, Solana hosted 356,300 unique users on Saturday, surpassing Ethereum’s nearly 330,000 by 10%. The milestone was driven by a sharp uptick in activity on Solana, with the network hosting only 208,000 active addresses on Nov. 7.


For comparison, Ethereum consistently hosted between 290,000 and 350,000 users daily over the majority of the past three months, with two brief spikes above 400,000 and a surge to more than 1M wallets.

Solana Overtakes Ethereum By Active Users After 70% Spike
Solana Overtakes Ethereum By Active Users After 70% Spike
The milestone is the latest sign of Solana’s recovery following last year’s brutal bear and the fallout from the collapse of its major investor, FTX.

The price of SOL plummeted more than 96% from its November 2021 all-time high of $250 to less than $10 in January, according to CoinGecko. Active addresses on the network shrank 85% from 1.28M in May 2022 to around 200,000 this September, according to The Block.

But Solana refused to stay down, with the network outperforming the broader markets amid the recent cryptocurrency rally as evidenced by the recent surge in active addresses.

The price of SOL is up 145% in four weeks, beating out many rival digital assets by at least double. The total value locked in Solana-based DeFi protocols is up 62% over the same period, according to DeFi Llama, while NFT sales volume grew 35% in the past 30 days, according to Crypto Slam.

The move followed progress towards Solana's firedancer upgrade in the form of a testnet, and dissipating expectations that the FTX bankruptcy estate would soon offload large sums of SOL on the markets.

Ethereum’s Layer 2s
While some analysts have been quick to pronounce that Solana has flipped Ethereum by active users in response to the recent uptick in activity. However, the Ethereum ecosystem has expanded beyond its base-layer, with the majority of activity now taking place on Layer 2.

According to data from Token Terminal, more than 800,000 users were active on the top seven Layer 2 networks over the past day combined. Coupled with the Ethereum mainnet, the data suggests more than 1M wallets were active across the Ethereum ecosystem. However, said data does not account for users operating the same wallet across multiple networks.

According to L2beat, Layer 2 networks are driving 80% of activity in Ethereum’s broader ecosystem, which is driving roughly 60 transactions per second.",Solana

GSOL shares are trading at a record $202, up from $87 at the start f the month. With SOL at $59 on Nov. 11 and the trust holding 0.38 SOL per share, that's an insane premium of 784%.

For context, the premium on Grayscale's Bitcoin Trust, GBTC, touched a record of 43% in July 2019.


The triple-digit premium signals increased appetite from institutional investors to get exposure to Solana. The rally comes as Solana's native token surged 40% in the past week, breaching $60 for the first time since May 2022.

Grayscale Trusts
Grayscale's cryptocurrency trusts have become the go-to way for financial institutions in the U.S. to access crypto, as it allows them to get exposure to digital assets while using traditional finance rails.

But unlike exchange-traded funds, holdings in Grayscale trusts don't directly track the market value of shares of the trusts, which leads to price premiums and discounts in the products.

Primary market sales of the trusts, when holding value and share price are at 1-to1, can only be accessed by accredited investors, with retail investors left to the mercy of the trusts' wild fluctuations.

There is only $6.3M of assets under management in GSOL, compared with $23B in GBTC.

ETF ambitions
Although Grayscale Trust shares are non-redeemable today, many pundits believe that may soon change.

Grayscale first applied to convert its Bitcoin Trust into a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund in Oct. 2021, but was knocked back by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). However, the U.S. District of Columbia Court of Appeal sided with Grayscale’s appeal in August, ruling that Grayscale’s Bitcoin Trust is “materially similar” to futures ETFs previously approved by the SEC.

Last month, the SEC declined to appeal the court’s decision before its October deadline expired, fuelling speculation that its ETF conversion may soon go ahead and pave the way for other Grayscale Trusts to undergo similar restructurings.

The news followed a spot Bitcoin ETF application from BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, in July, which ignited bullish expectations that the first exchange-traded fund investing in spot BTC may soon receive regulatory approval.

GBTC shares similarly outperformed spot Bitcoin in recent months, with GBTC up 200% year-to-date while BTC gained 10% over the same period.",Solana

Cardano (ADA-USD)

Cardano (ADA-USD) is due for a rebound at some point, if only because it has performed so poorly over the year. During that period, it has fallen by more than 18%, even though it has made up some of the loss in 2023, rising from $0.25 to $0.32 of late.

Cardano remains the idealist’s altcoin at this point. It’s designed to be greener than Ethereum (ETH-USD) or Bitcoin and was created by Charles Hoskinson, who had deep ties to Ethereum.

Cardano is utilitarian at its heart. The project focuses on creating dApps that provide real-world utility to its user base. In particular, MELD is worth paying attention to. It is a banking app that brings fiat and crypto together. It aims to meld the traditional banking world and update it with cryptocurrency. Cardano continues to develop smart contract functionality, which will ultimately help modernize it and improve its utility. This makes it one of those cryptos to buy.

Kaspa (KAS-USD)

Kaspa (KAS-USD) is really about scalability at its heart. That means it aims to be so fast that it will grow dramatically. Remember, Ethereum has faced significant trouble with throughput or transaction speeds. Its slow transaction speeds allowed alternative cryptos, including Solana (SOL-USD), to grow massively.

Kaspa boasts transaction speeds above 35,000 per second, according to some sources. The risk is that Kaspa’s early claims might not hold up over time. Kaspa recently launched its mainnet, so it’s still very early in its development. It will take time for its transaction speed to be reliably verified.

That could go well, and it could go badly. Beyond that, Kaspa also relies on a unique consensus mechanism that differentiates it from accepted and known security models. Again, there’s very little with which an investor can reliably assert that Kaspa will succeed with its consensus mechanism. It’s certainly a gamble, and in the world of early cryptos, that’s precisely the kind of bet that produces massive returns.

Zilliqa (ZIL-USD)

Zilliqa (ZIL-USD) is all about sharding and the benefits of sharding confers. The term sharding refers to partitioning databases and networks into smaller constituent parts. Those shards are more easily processed, leading to faster transaction speeds and greater scalability. Zilliqa has asserted that it is the pioneer in the crypto sharding field. It isn’t the only crypto project utilizing sharding, as many other projects, including Cardano, employ the technique.

Renewed interest in the metaverse also bodes well for Zilliqa. It relaunched its metaverse venture in September. That venture, formerly known as Metapolis, has been renamed MetaMinds. All in all, it’s one of those cryptos to buy.

The press release associated with relaunching the project is short on details but focuses on many of the same points earlier efforts cited. That means many investors continue to believe in AR/VR, gaming, and all of those high-growth potential focal points. Rate hikes may be done, so that might provide all the fuel a project like Zilliqa needs to spike quickly.",Solana

""A brief window opens on November 9 for the SEC to potentially approve all 12 US spot bitcoin ETF applicants, including Grayscale's GBTC. It will be open for at least eight days.

A spot bitcoin ETF is a financial product that investors hope will open the gateway for mainstream capital to flood the crypto market. If the SEC approves the multiple spot bitcoin ETF applications that have been filed with the US regulatory authority, the digital asset space could receive multiple benefits, such as:

Regulatory Oversight: An ETF would be under SEC jurisdiction, lending it credibility.
Retail Accessibility: ETFs are more accessible to the general public, opening the door to more widespread bitcoin investment.
Investor Protection: The SEC’s role in ensuring that the financial product meets rigorous standards enhances its appeal.

Solana (SOL)

Solana (SOL-USD) has been recognized for its high throughput and low transaction costs. These factors make it a potential candidate for widespread adoption, especially in decentralized finance (DeFi) and decentralized applications (dApps).

Despite past associations with the troubled FTX, Solana has shown resilience. Solana more than doubled in value recently. The technical analysis suggests a bullish trend with the potential for further gains if it maintains support levels.

Investors are advised to watch for a confirmation of support above $40 for new buy-ins, aiming for a target of $50. It’s price action like this which makes SOL one of those cryptos to buy.

Polkadot (DOT)

Polkadot (DOT-USD) aims to enable different blockchains to transfer messages and value trust-free. DOT is sharing their unique features while pooling their security. The year 2023 has been a standout year for DOT. The main reason DOT is one of those cryptos to buy is due to the strength of its network fundamentals.

DOT has seen significant growth and development, with a surge in developer contributions reaching a peak of 19,090 on GitHub. Staking has grown by 49%, with Nomination Pools democratizing the process and attracting more than 15,281 members.

Furthermore, the integration with Circle’s USDC and the launch of the Rocco Testnet are set to improve liquidity, financial infrastructure and network performance.

There’s more in store for investors. I feel that DOT is just getting started when it comes to getting its network off the ground.

Chainlink (LINK-USD) is a decentralized oracle network that aims to connect smart contracts with data from the real world.

LINK has been on another hot run out of these cryptos to buy. The coin is experiencing an uptrend with a current price increase to $11.40, up by 3.40%. It’s showing promising signs for a bullish rally based on key metrics, including a 1,012% surge in exchange net flow, indicating a high volume of LINK moving out of exchanges, potentially due to staking incentives.

Some crypto analysts predict that coins like LINK will undergo a significant rally. The expected upside quoted by some is as high as 100%. This anticipated move is expected as the United States Dollar Index shows signs of topping out, which could signal a favorable upcoming six months for risk assets like cryptocurrencies.

Major Announcements
The soaring price follows a series of announcements Solana-based developers and teams have made at the blockchain's Breakpoint conference in Amsterdam. The event stared Oct. 30 and ends Nov. 3.


Significant developments include Firedancer - the ground-up rebuild of a Solana client by Jump Crypto is now live on test net.

Also, the first smart wallets on Solana have gone live, thanks to the efforts of Fuse Wallet. Solana's founder, Anatoly Yakovenko, equated this progress to account abstraction on Solana.

Solana data has also been integrated with Google Cloud BigQuery, Google Cloud's serverless data warehouse that is known for its machine learning, AI, and business intelligence capabilities.

FTX Shadow
Adding to the rising optimism around the token is a recent report by VanEck. The investment firm predicts that by 2030 SOL could reach $3,211, outshining anticipated returns from Ethereum.

The rally also comes as Sam Bankman-Fried’s trial is underway. While the disgraced FTX founder who was instrumental in supporting the Solana ecosystem is under scrutiny, it looks as if investors are now ready to move past that black spot and focus on the network's potential.

Notably, market players seem to be overlooking the fact that FTX controllers have withdrawn 1.6M SOL tokens. Although these tokens have not been sent to an exchange yet, the transfer could indicate future sales, injecting some caution into the buoyant market.",Solana
https://finance.yahoo.com/news/lido-exits-solana-following-community-185222453.html,"Lido Exits Solana Following Community Vote
","the largest Ethereum staking network, decided to exit the Solana blockchain as revenue that was expected to come in from the operation didn't offset its development and marketing costs.

Lido reached the decision to leave the second-largest chain by value staked after a poll on the decision closed with 92.7% of participants voting to sunset operations on the chain.


P2P Validator, the Lido on Solana development team, had so far invested ~$700,000 primarily in development and support. Their revenue during this period was around $220,000, including developer fees and milestone rewards, resulting in a net loss for Lido of ~$484,000, according to a post on the Lido forum.

P2P Validator put forth a proposal to the Lido community suggesting an estimated cost of $1.5M for the next 12 months. This figure was intended to cover various expenses, including a quarterly development retainer of $200,000, an annual adoption incentive program of $600,000 and $100,000 for customer support.

P2P's Expansion Vision
P2P projected that with the proposed funding, Lido on Solana could grow and secure more than 1% of the Solana staking market share.

The team estimated that a 1% share of the staking market in Solana would result in treasury income of approximately 10,191 SOL over 12 months. At current prices, this amount translates to approximately $200,000.

Total staked tokens on Solana are worth about $9.35B, compared with $43.7B on Ethereum, according to stakingrewards.com.

Community Decision
Despite the potential upside presented by P2P Validator, the Lido community argued the proposal doesn't make economic sense.

""Why would DAO treasury have exposure to 1.5m USD invest for potential return of 10k SOL,"" wrote a user under the name Marin in the forum. ""Voters need to be aware that it would require 7.6x increase in SOL price for treasury to be at 0.""

A forum commenter by the user name of btuck added that the Solana Foundation hasn't been supportive of liquid staking.

""Solana Foundation isn’t supporting liquid staking with their own SOL yet, and there is also a significant amount of locked SOL (~60M) that is not eligible either,"" they wrote. ""And Solana DeFi needs to be tested further for big accounts to really trust them with size.""

Blessing for Competitors
With Lido bowing out of the Solana ecosystem, the competitive landscape clears up for liquid staking projects Marinade Finance and Jito, both of which have incentive programs in place to attract users, analyst DeFi Ignas wrote on X/Twitter.

""In fact, Jito has been growing faster thanks to the Jito Points airdr0p system where you get points not only for holding JitoSOL but actively using it in DeFi for providing LP or lending,"" DeFi Ignas wrote.

Sunsetting Process
stSOL token holders will still receive network rewards during the sunsetting process but will only be able to unstake via the Lido on Solana frontend until Feb. 4, 2024. Afterward, unstaking will need to be done through its command-line interface.

Node operators will be provided voluntary off-boarding instructions via Lido community channels.

The key dates of the sunsetting process are as follows:

October 16, 2023: Lido on Solana staking will be discontinued, and no new stakes will be accepted.

November 17, 2023: The voluntary node operator off-boarding process will begin.

February 4, 2024: The Lido on Solana frontend support will be concluded. After this point, unstaking will only feasible via the Command Line Interface (CLI).

It’s notable that a cost-saving feature has generated so much use on Solana. The blockchain already has cheap fees relative to Ethereum — even in a low-demand environment, a simple token transfer on Ethereum costs $0.63 while Solana transactions generally cost fractions of a cent.

Bubblegum uses Merkle Trees, a data structure widely used across blockchains, to bring down the cost of minting the cNFTs. This is because scanning the items in a Merkle Tree scales logarithmically, meaning that minting larger numbers of NFTs results in lower costs per cNFT.

Ethereum (ETH-USD)

Ethereum (ETH-USD) and Bitcoin (BTC-USD) remain the top contenders in the cryptocurrency market. Ethereum’s recent one-year anniversary of its transition to Proof-of-Stake (POS) from mining significantly reduced its energy consumption, although it didn’t lead to a price surge. Nonetheless, Ethereum continues to be one of the most prominent cryptos.

Analysts believe Ethereum can outpace Bitcoin in the coming years. According to Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin, Ethereum’s development is 55% complete after the 2022 merge, while Bitcoin’s is at 80%. This suggests significant room for Ethereum platform growth. Scalability, with the potential for 100,000 transactions, and reduced transaction costs, could be game-changing catalysts.

Of course, more development means greater risks that something will break along the way. However, for now, Ethereum’s progress in its journey to become the leading blockchain in the world has been impressive. Thus far, Ethereum remains the dominant force in decentralized finance, where most of the money in this space is focused. Until that changes, Ethereum has to be a top pick.

Solana (SOL-USD)

Solana (SOL-USD) soared to $260 in 2021, but has since faltered, falling to less than $25 per token. At these levels, however, this high-growth crypto is one that appears to be worth considering. This is one of the cryptos you should add to your portfolio. 

Solana, often compared to Ethereum, has achieved 100% uptime in Q2 2023 and is making strides in the mobile crypto market with the Saga phone optimized for crypto. Price predictions for SOL in 2023 vary from $14.76 to $39.54, but its long-term future remains uncertain, with varying estimates for 2025 and 2030.

Solana’s SOL token was the day’s biggest gainer in the top 10 cryptocurrencies, rising 4.59% in the 24 hours leading up to 4:30 p.m. in Hong Kong, to US$20. The token rose 10.83% in the past week, rising from its two-month low of US$17.74 on Sept. 9.


In the wider crypto market, Bitcoin rose 0.89% in the past 24 hours to US$26,940.

“Bitcoin has started showing signs of very short-term recovery. Nonetheless, the ongoing volatility in the crypto market remains a concern for investors, who are still enamored in the larger movements taking place on the stock market,” Lucas Kiely, the chief investment officer of digital asset platform Yield App, told Forkast.

“The entrance of large institutions into the cryptocurrency market has positive short-term influences on Bitcoin prices. Their participation brings credibility and stability to an otherwise volatile market, potentially attracting more investors,” added Kiely, referring to Standard Chartered launching its crypto custody arm last week.

Ether, the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency, also rose 0.49% in afternoon trading to US1,640, bringing its weekly gains to 3.78%.

ImmutableX became the second-largest blockchain network by 24-hour NFT sales volume, rising 17.54% to US$1.36 million, boosted by a 70% surge in Gods Unchained Cards, that generated US$1.2 million in sales for the network, becoming the largest collection by daily sales across all chains, according to CryptoSlam.

Following yesterday’s sales surge, Bitcoin slipped from the second largest to the fifth-largest blockchain network by 24-hour NFT sales volume, falling 21.54% to US$973,023.

Embattled Chinese property developer Country Garden brought some release for investors, after it secured a debt deal from its creditors and avoided default.

Investors are refocusing on the U.S. Federal Reserve’s two-day policy meeting that starts today. The CME FedWatch Tool predicts a 99% chance the central bank will keep the current rate unchanged in September, up from 92% one week ago. Rates are now at a 22-year high of 5.25%-5.5%.

Crypto market on positive note
Bitcoin rose 1.78% to US$26,364 in 24 hours to 4 p.m. in Hong Kong, according to CoinMarketCap data. The largest cryptocurrency in the world gained 2.37% in the past seven days.

Ether strengthened 2.3% to US$1,623 but slipped 0.73% on the week.

“These positive sentiments came amid more regulatory battles in the United States between regulatory bodies and those working in the field of cryptocurrencies and their various applications,” said Samer Hasn, market analyst at multi-asset brokerage firm XS.com.

The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) imposed a fine of US$1 million on the makers of Stoner Cats 2 non-fungible tokens (NFT) and its accompanying web series on charges of offering and selling unregistered securities as NFTs.

Stoner Cats 2 has accepted the regulator’s cease-and-desist order and agreed to the US$1 million civil penalty.

“A settlement to avoid a crushing SEC process without ‘admitting or denying’ anything is binding on no one. A cynic would call it a PR stunt. What matters is that when seriously challenged in court, the SEC continues to lose,” Stuart Alderoty, chief legal officer of Ripple, said on X (formerly Twitter).

Ripple is also fighting its own battle against the SEC. In July, a summary judgment by Judge Torres ruled that Ripple’s XRP sales to institutional investors violated securities laws, but sales on public exchanges to retail investors did not. However, the SEC submitted a filing last Friday that pushed the court of the Southern District of New York to appeal its ruling on the agency’s lawsuit against Ripple Labs.

The SEC requested the court review its prior ruling by Judge Analisa Torres, which posed “knotty legal problems,” according to the filing.


Ripple’s XRP token gained 1.23% to US$0.4816, but weakened 3.72% in the past seven days.

Solana was the day’s biggest gainer, rising 5.02% to US$18.81, but lost 3.86% on the week. Global payments giant Visa wrote in a Tuesday research report that Solana blockchain “has attributes like high transaction throughput and scalability at low cost that help make it a good candidate for payments and Visa’s stablecoin settlement pilot.” It announced a partnership with Solana on Sept. 5 to expand its USDC stablecoin settlement pilot to Solana’s blockchain.

The total crypto market capitalization rose 1.56% to 1.05 trillion while market volume dropped 12.87% to US$27.96 billion.

Bored Ape Yacht Club tops NFT collections
The indexes are proxy measures of the performance of the global NFT market. They are managed by CryptoSlam, a sister company of Forkast.News under the Forkast.Labs umbrella.

The Forkast 500 NFT index dropped 1.85% in 24 hours to 6.45 p.m. in Hong Kong, bringing its weekly losses to 5.22%. Forkast’s Ethereum and Solana indexes also declined while the Polygon index rose 9.44%.

Total NFT sales volume gained 43.13% to US$14.81 million in the past 24 hours, while the number of buyers increased 5.93%, according to CryptoSlam data.

Among blockchains, Ethereum topped rankings, rising 57.59% to US$8.47 million. Polygon and Mythos networks ranked second and third.

Ethereum-based Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) topped collections as sales volume jumped 465.76% to US$1.41 million in the past 24 hours. At the same time, Mythos-based DMarket and Polygon-based DraftKings ranked second and third.

Bored Ape has introduced the Made By Apes (MBA) Bodega which will act as the official directory for all valid and active MBA licenses.

“It’s been incredible to watch Apes build out their IP over the years. The directory is live pulling from on chain MBA licenses to display all the Bored Ape and Mutant Ape creations in one place. Keep your eyes peeled as more licenses are approved and added to the Bodega,” BAYC tweeted.

Asian equity markets mostly rose on Thursday after the People’s Bank of China announced a 25 basis point reduction in the reserve requirement ratio – the amount of cash lenders must hold in reserve – for the second time this year to accelerate China’s economic recovery. The announcement does not apply to those that have already implemented a 5% reserve ratio.

China’s Shanghai Composite gained while Shenzhen Component Index dropped. South Korea’s Kospi, Hong Kong’s Hang Seng, and Japan’s Nikkei 225 also strengthened.

India’s benchmark index Sensex rose 0.08% at the close of trading hours on Thursday. Fitch Ratings on Thursday retained India’s growth forecast for the current fiscal at 6.3%, and 6.5% for next fiscal, as the world’s most populous nation continues to show resilience despite tighter monetary policy and weak exports.


U.S. stock futures rose as of 7.30 p.m. in Hong Kong on Thursday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average futures, the S&P 500 futures, and the Nasdaq 100 Futures were all in the green.

The U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI), a key inflation indicator, rose 3.7% on year in August, an acceleration from 3.2% in July. The August CPI also booked a monthly gain of 0.6%, the biggest increase since June 2022. Meanwhile, the core CPI — which excludes the volatile food and energy prices — rose 4.3% by year in August, a deceleration from 4.7% in July and the smallest reading since September 2021.

The Federal Reserve will hold interest rates steady in September, before hiking them again next time, according to Nigel Green, founder and chief executive of financial management group deVere.

“This latest U.S. CPI data is unlikely to move the needle on the Fed’s highly anticipated move to hold rates steady at their meeting next week – which has already been priced-in by financial markets,” Green said.

“But the uptick in inflation gives the U.S. central bank extra reason to be hawkish moving forward. As such, we also expect the Fed will start to prepare the market for a rate increase at its November meeting,” he added.

The CME FedWatch Tool predicts a 97% chance the central bank will maintain the current rate unchanged in its meeting on Sept. 20, which is currently in the range between 5.25% and 5.5%. It gives a 58.4% chance for another pause in November, up from 56.8% on Wednesday.

The U.S. August producer price index (PPI) is set to be released on Thursday, with analysts expecting the data to rise 1.2% by year, up from 0.8% in July.

European bourses were mixed ahead of the European Central Bank’s (ECB) policy meeting on Thursday, which is expected to indicate whether the central bank will increase interest rates further. Eurozone inflation has persistently remained above 5%, significantly above than the central bank’s 2% target, even after nine consecutive increases in borrowing costs.",Solana

US inflation in August rose for the first time since June 2022, rising to 3.7% after an increase in energy prices. This was hotter than July's 3.2% reading and above the consensus forecast of 3.6%.

Inflation remains far above the Federal Reserve’s target rate of 2%. August's reading leaves the door open for further interest-rate hikes from the US central bank.

FTX gets approval to sell remaining assets
On Wednesday, FTX received US court approval to commence liquidation of its remaining cryptocurrency assets. The sell-off will allow the bankrupt exchange to repay creditors in US dollars and minimise risks related to price volatility in crypto markets.

FTX's proposal was granted at a court hearing in Wilmington, Delaware. The details involve the exchange being allowed to sell up to $100m (£80m) in cryptocurrency per week. The firm can also enter into hedging and staking agreements that will allow it to minimise the risk of price volatility and earn passive income through staking crypto tokens, like ether.

Altcoins rally despite FTX liquidation fears
Major altcoins did not suffer a market route after the FTX liquidation proposal was granted. The bankrupt exchange's remaining crypto-asset holdings are heavily weighted towards blue-chip altcoins, particularly solana and ether.

Apart from having over $560m (£448m) in bitcoin, FTX also owns $1.16bn (£0.93bn) in solana (SOL-USD), $192m (£153m) in ethereum (ETH-USD), and $137m (£109m) in aptos (APT-USD), according to a recent court filing.

Solana holders showed no sign of trepidation considering how much of the token could be sold gradually over the coming weeks. SOL posted a 3.4% gain in the past 24 hours, to a current price of $18.83 (£15.08).

However, traders may be anticipating that the remaining FTX holdings in solana and ether could be staked rather than sold on the open market, so the bankrupt firm could gain yields on the assets.

Despite reclaiming the key US$26,000 line, Bitcoin’s momentum has seemingly weakened on Tuesday, but is “still strong enough to hold on to most of what was reclaimed after the bounce,” Keith Alan, co-founder of monitoring resource Material Indicators, tweeted on Wednesday.

Bitcoin still faces multiple technical resistances, including a “death cross” between the token’s 50-day and 200-day simple moving averages – which currently sit at US$27,444 and US$27,670, as well as a 100-day moving average at US$28,292 that outlines the ceiling of the range, according to Alan on Tuesday.

Ether also gained 0.95% to US$1,609.32 but still traded 1.64% lower in the past seven days. The second top crypto reached a 24-hour high of US$1,619.11 on Tuesday night.

Bitcoin and Ether prices briefly dipped on early Thursday morning in Asia after the bankrupt crypto exchange FTX received court approval to sell its US$3.4 billion worth of crypto assets. The selling is capped at US$100 million per week, which can be extended to US$200 million.

FTX’s current crypto holdings include US$1.16 billion in Solana’s SOL and US$560 million in Bitcoin, according to a Monday court filing.

Despite the incoming FTX liquidation, crypto prices remain largely stable. All other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies posted gains in the past 24 hours. SOL led the winners, which rose 2.70% to US$18.43 but lost 6.70% for the week.

Visa wrote in a Tuesday research report that Solana blockchain “has attributes like high transaction throughput and scalability at low cost that help make it a good candidate for payments and Visa’s stablecoin settlement pilot.” The global payment giant announced a partnership with Solana on Sept. 5 to expand its USDC stablecoin settlement pilot to Solana’s blockchain

The total crypto market capitalization gained 1.07% in the past 24 hours to US$1.04 trillion, while trading volume dropped 21.30% to US$27.63 billion.

“The recent stability could be attributed to steady CPI data, as is common amongst high-risk asset classes,” said John Stefanidis, CEO and co-founder of blockchain infrastructure DAO, Balthazar DAO.

“Moreover, it seems the crypto market may have already priced in the potential ramifications of FTX’s approved sale of its substantial $3.4 billion crypto asset portfolio,” added Stefanidis.

U.S. annual inflation rate accelerates

U.S. stock futures were trading higher as of 09:30 a.m. in Hong Kong, after Wall Street closed mixed on Wednesday, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite logging gains while the Dow Jones Industrial Average edging lower.

Most main stock indexes in Asia rose on Thursday morning. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng, South Korea’s Kospi and Japan’s Nikkei 225 all logged gains, while China’s Shanghai Composite inched down 0.03%.

The U.S. CPI release on Wednesday sent mixed information to the market. The inflation gauge rose 3.7% by year in August, an acceleration from 3.2% in July. The August CPI also booked a monthly gain of 0.6%, the biggest increase since June 2022.

The accelerated CPI growth aligns with analysts’ expectation, according to Reuters on Thursday. Gasoline price, which jumped 10.6% in August, accounted for over 50% of the CPI growth in the month.

Meanwhile, the core CPI — which excludes the volatile food and energy prices — rose 4.3% by year in August, a deceleration from 4.7% in July and the smallest reading since September 2021.

“There is nothing here to seriously put a Fed rate hike on the table next week, but there is enough to keep the debate about the need for one more hike in 2023 alive,” Conrad DeQuadros, senior economic advisor at U.S.-based investment bank Brean Capital, told Reuters.

Given the mixed CPI data, J.P.Morgan Asset Management wrote on Wednesday it expects the Federal Reserve to make no further interest rate hike in this monetary tightening cycle.

“Despite still rising oil prices in early September, we expect the impact of oil price spikes on CPI to be limited,” J.P.Morgan’s Chief Global Strategist David Kelly said in a note viewed by Reuters, who expects the annual inflation rate will fall below the Fed’s long-term goal of 2% by the fourth quarter of 2024.

The CME FedWatch Tool predicts a 97% chance the central bank will maintain the current rate unchanged in its meeting on Sept. 20, which is currently in the range between 5.25% and 5.50%. It gives a 58.4% chance for another pause in November, up from 56.8% on Wednesday.

The U.S. August producer price index (PPI) is set to be released on Thursday, with analysts expecting the data to rise 1.2% by year, up from 0.8% in July. The data will provide further insights into the Fed’s future monetary policies.",Solana
https://finance.yahoo.com/news/crypto-assets-slump-ahead-us-032303894.html,Crypto Assets Slump Ahead Of US Inflation Report,"Crypto markets had a shaky start to the week ahead of US inflation data and potential asset sales by the failed FTX crypto exchange.

Most digital assets ranked among the top 20 by market capitalizations slumped between 2% and 4% on Monday, with Bitcoin dropping 2% to $25,000 and Ether tumbling 3.5% to $1,560.

Solana (SOL), the largest cryptocurrency on FTX’s balance sheet, shed 9% over the past seven days. Other notable FTX holdings Ripple (XRP), Aptos (APT), and BitDAO (BIT) are similarly down 6.7%, 8.7%, and 9.5% respectively. A U.S. court is expected to deliver a verdict on Sept. 13 regarding FTX’s proposed plans to begin selling assets.


For comparison, most top ten cryptocurrencies pulled back by between 4% and 5% over the same period. The US Bureau of Labor Statistics will release inflation figures for August on Wednesday morning, and investors will be looking at the data to try and predict the Fed’s next rate decision on Sept. 20.

On Monday, FTX submitted a court filing breaking down the crypto holdings of FTX, FTX.US, and its sister trading firm, Alameda Holdings, as of Aug. 31.

SOL is the largest position at $1.16B, followed by $597M worth of BTC and WBTC, $229M in ETH and WETH, $120 million in USDT, and $119 million of XRP. Holdings of $49M in BitDAO (BIT) and $46M of Stargate (STG) round out FTX’s ten largest positions — making up 72% of FTX’s $3.4B digital asset portfolio.

Fortunately for SOL investors, the massive tranche of tokens is subject to a vesting schedule, meaning the tokens will steadily enter supply over the coming years. Roughly 34.5M SOL will unlock monthly until 2028, with an additional 12M SOL unlocking each month until Sept. 2027, according to Xangle. A final tranche of 7.5M SOL can be sold in 2025.

DeFi Downtrend Persists
The combined capitalization of DeFi assets slumped 6.8% over the weekend, according to CoinGecko.

The majority of the sector’s top tokens by market cap lost value over the past seven days, including 12 assets with a loss of more than 7.5%. Five tokens bucked the trend with double-digit gains, including Tellor (TRB), Flamingo (FLM), and Perpetual Protocol (PERP) with rallies of more than 40%.

DeFi Market Cap
DeFi Market Cap
The total value locked (TVL) in DeFi assets also continues to decline, with TVL falling $2B to $36.5B over the past two weeks. DeFi TVL is now down 31% since mid-April.

Layer 2 Throughput Hits New Record
Ethereum’s L2 ecosystem continues to grow despite the downtrend, with combined Layer 2 throughput posting an all-time high of 55.4 transactions per second (TPS) on Sept. 10, according to L2beat.

While the milestone came one day after Starknet posted a high of 10 TPS amid renewed airdrop speculation, L2 activity is up across the board. The throughput of the top eight Layer 2s is each up compared to one week ago, with Base, Immutable X, Mantle, and dYdX all up more than 40%.

Ether dipped, while most other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies traded flat to lower, with Solana’s SOL the only one strengthening. The Forkast 500 NFT index moved up after the NFT market saw the largest weekly total transactions since February 2022. Most Asian stock markets dropped after China unexpectedly lowered its interest rate on Tuesday morning and released weaker-than-expected economic data. U.S. stock futures also declined and European bourses traded lower.

Bitcoin, Ether flat; Solana rises
Bitcoin remained unchanged in the last 24 hours to trade at US$29,380.78 as of 5 p.m. in Hong Kong, and logged a weekly gain of 0.82%, according to CoinMarketCap data. The world’s leading cryptocurrency briefly reached a high of US$29,660.25 early Tuesday morning.


Bitcoin prices are below its 50-day moving average of US$29,887, with its 30-day realized volatility falling to 17%, the lowest since November 2018, which both indicate bearishness in the token, Markus Thielen, head of research & strategy at digital asset service platform Matrixport, said in an emailed note on Tuesday.

Meanwhile, the “Greed & Fear Index prints 54% for Bitcoin, above the 21-day moving average which signals that a rally could occur imminently,” added Thielen.

Bitcoin’s price has remained largely within at US$29,000-30,600 for the past seven weeks, causing frustration among investors seeking higher rewards. However, low volatility could prove to be a blessing in disguise, said Nigel Green, founder and chief executive officer of financial management group deVere, in an emailed statement.

“This newfound stability attracts institutional investors, who have been historically wary of entering the market due to its extreme price swings,” Green said.

“This stability is also a boon for businesses and consumers looking for a reliable store of value or medium of exchange,” he added.

Digital asset investment products saw an inflow of US$29 million in the week ending Aug. 11. That followed three consecutive weeks of outflows totalling around US$144 million, according to a Monday report by European alternative asset manager CoinShares. Bitcoin saw an inflow of US$27 million — roughly 93% of the total inflows.

The inflows to digital asset investment products are “likely due to the recent U.S. inflation data, which was slightly below expectations, signifying that a September rate hike is less likely,” CoinShares wrote in the report.

Ether dipped 0.33% to US$1,840.95 but added 0.71% for the past seven days. Other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies all traded lower with the exception of Solana’s SOL, which moved up 1.39% to US$24.82 and gained 7.09% for the week.

Synthesis One, an artificial intelligence (AI) data crowdsourcing platform based on the Solana blockchain, launched its new train-to-earn application “Workspace by Synesis” on Monday.

The app allows users to train AIs as data providers while earning cryptocurrencies as rewards. This process, Synthesis One claims, will result in a “fully traceable and auditable” data supply chain.

Shiba Inu, which has recently replaced Polkadot as the 10th biggest non-stablecoin cryptocurrency by market cap, led the losers, falling 2.89% to US$0.00001028 while logging a weekly jump of 14.51%

The token received a boost from the incoming launch of Shibarium, a layer-2 network built by Shiba Inu developers whose launch date is yet to be unveiled.

Blockchain analytics platform Lookonchain noted Tuesday that bankrupt crypto lender Voyager Digital had been selling its assets including Shiba Inu, which could weaken the upward trend in the token.

Ether also edged up, while other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies traded flat to higher. Solana’s SOL led the winners. As risk sentiment improved in the wake of weak U.S. inflation data, last week saw an inflow for digital asset investment products after three consecutive weeks of outflows. Meanwhile, the Forkast 500 NFT index moved up after the NFT market logged the largest weekly total transactions since February 2022. U.S. stock futures traded mixed after Wall Street closed higher Monday on the back of a rally led by chipmaker Nvidia.

“This stability is also a boon for businesses and consumers looking for a reliable store of value or medium of exchange,” he added.

Matteo Greco, research analyst at Canada-based digital asset investment firm Fineqia International, said in an emailed note that low volatility does not necessarily mean low investor interest in the coin.

Greco pointed to the Bitcoin long-term holder level — a metric that measures the percentage of Bitcoin holders who have held the coin for over 155 days —which reached its highest ever level over the first week of August.

“The data shows how the vast majority of BTC holders did not execute trades in the last few months, as the low volumes and the almost inexistent volatility recorded in the last two months suggest,” said Greco.

“These numbers are also typical to be observed during the summer months, especially July and August, and do not reflect a decrease in investors’ interest towards the digital asset market,” he added.

Meanwhile, digital asset investment products saw an inflow of US$29 million in the week ending August 11. That followed three consecutive weeks of outflows totalling around US$144 million, according to a Monday report by European alternative asset manager CoinShares.

Outside the top 10 cryptos, HBAR, the utility token of distributed ledger technology platform Hedera Hashgraph, saw its price surge 13.59% in the past 24 hours to US$0.06666. That contributed to a weekly jump of 12.89%.

HBAR received a boost after Dropp, a Hedera-based micropayments application, was added to the U.S. Federal Reserve’s instant payments platform FedNow. The Fed-run service allows merchants to “accept small-value purchases digitally without paying large transaction fees” following its launch in July.

The total crypto market capitalization moved up 0.40% in the past 24 hours to US$1.17 trillion, while trading volume rose 47.95% to US$28.52 billion.

Weekly NFT transactions hit year-long high
The indexes are proxy measures of the performance of the global NFT market. They are managed by CryptoSlam, a sister company of Forkast.News under the Forkast.Labs umbrella.

The main Forkast 500 NFT index moved up 0.39% in the past 24 hours to 2,486.89 as of 09:50 a.m. in Hong Kong, and notched a 0.27% gain for the week. Forkast’s Ethereum and Polygon NFT indexes also logged gains, while the indexes for Solana and Cardano dropped.

Total NFT trading volume rose 22.88% in the past 24 hours to over US$16.48 million, according to data from CryptoSlam. Volumes on the Ethereum, Solana, Polygon, and Cardano blockchains all logged gains, while volume on the Bitcoin blockchain dipped.

In the week ending August 13, NFT sales topped US$101 million after sitting short of US$100 million for three consecutive weeks. Meanwhile, NFT transactions for the week totaled more than 2.80 million, a high not seen since February 2022.

Yehudah Petscher, NFT Strategist at Forkast Labs, commenting on the past week’s surge in NFT sales, said that he saw the emergence of low-priced collections as key to a sustained potential uptick in the market.

“We’re getting a glimpse of the future of NFTs. More affordable prices, higher volume, likely big brands and this is what we’re seeing in DraftKings, DMarket, Gods Unchained, and Sorare,” said Petscher.

Combined, Petscher noted, those three collections alone notched 872,185 transactions — nearly a third of the week’s total transactions.

“The question is, is this sustainable? I think it is, and that’s exactly why this will be the future. Traders haven’t really left NFT, they just ran out of liquidity since there’s no profits. But they can afford NFTs that are priced at just a few dollars,” Petscher added.

Among NFT collections, Ethereum-based DeGods saw the largest 24-hour sales volume. The collection surged 144.25% to over US$2.21 million after the project launched its “Season 3” digital art collection on Sunday.

Rather than introducing new NFTs, Season 3 allows its holders to upgrade their original DeGods NFT and receive four generative artworks.

Mythos Chain-based DMarket and ImmutableX-based Gods Unchained — two video game-adjacent collections — came in second and third place in terms of 24-hour sales volume.

Bitcoin prices may struggle until Sept.
Bitcoin inched up 0.04% in the last 24 hours to US$29,393 at 4 p.m. in Hong Kong, bringing its weekly gains to 1.24%, according to CoinMarketCap data. At the same time, the world’s largest cryptocurrency’s market capitalization dropped 0.03% to US$571.67 billion.

“Bitcoin prices have been pinned at US$29,000 for three weeks, refusing to decline, despite the correction in some large-cap technology stocks – Apple, Nvidia, and Microsoft,” Markus Thielen, head of research and strategy at digital asset service platform Matrixport, said in an emailed statement on Thursday.

“Two significant catalysts are supporting Bitcoin and Ethereum prices into year-end: the potential SEC approval for a U.S.-listed physical Bitcoin ETF and Ethereum’s EIP-4844 upgrade, which is expected in Q4 2023,” Thielen added.

Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency, dropped 0.02% to US$1,848 in the past 24 hours.

Ethereum’s EIP-4844 upgrade, with the introduction of ‘blobs’ of data – a new transaction type – is expected to reduce transaction fees and increase transaction throughput.

In June, BlackRock and a number of major U.S. financial institutions filed applications with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to create spot Bitcoin ETFs. The SEC was expected to announce its decision on Ark Investment’s spot Bitcoin ETF application on Aug. 13. However, the regulator said in a Friday filing that it will solicit public comment on the ETF proposal, effectively pushing back the deadline.

“More SEC responses will also be expected during the first week of September, when seven other Bitcoin ETF filings are required to receive a response from the SEC. The possibility is high that several Bitcoin ETFs would be approved in short order, igniting the next leg higher in Bitcoin prices as those ETF providers would spend considerable marketing expenses to draw in retail and institutional capital,” Thielen added.


However, Bitcoin prices could decline by September to about US$26,000 to US$27,000 as the summer lull ends, Thielen cautioned, adding that this could be an attractive buying opportunity for the seasonal rally in the fourth quarter.

“Bitcoin prices would struggle until September before they start their ascent again. This is happening, and our inclination of being very cautious in managing our positions in the short term but we are eying another perfect buying opportunity to prepare for the year-end rally and the expectations for a strong 2024,” he added.

Bitcoin’s next halving event is expected in April 2024, when the amount of new Bitcoin issued is cut in half, increasing its scarcity and pushing up the token’s price.

Dogecoin led losers in the past 24 hours, followed by Solana, although both posted gains on the week. Dogecoin lost 1.90% to US$0.07491 in the last 24 hours but gained 0.32% on the week. At the same time, Solana dropped 1.44% to US$24.39 while gaining 5.59% in the past seven days.

Bitcoin was little changed during afternoon trading in Asia, trading at US$29,397 as of 4:30 p.m. in Hong Kong after it briefly rallied to a weekly high of US$30,144 on Tuesday.


“If Bitcoin holds above US$27,500, it could test US$31,000-32,000. There’s also a pivot at approximately US$28,200, which could prove to be solid support. If it were to hold, the price of Bitcoin could rally and even break out,” Lucas Kiely, chief investment officer of digital asset platform Yield App, told Forkast, adding that we’re in a “bullish scenario.”

“If it does break below the current trendline, it would signal a possible end to a long term uptrend, dating back to the regional banking crisis in the US when Silicon Valley Bank, Metropolitan Bank and Silvergate shuttered.”

Bitcoin’s 24-hour non-fungible token sales rose for a second consecutive day, gaining 8.35% to US$348,449 with the network remaining the seventh largest blockchain by 24-hour NFT sales volume, according to CryptoSlam.

Ethereum’s 24-hour NFT sales rallied 62.68% to US$13.43 million, propelled by stronger interest in DeGods that saw sales rise 572% in the past 24 hours to US$3.13 million, making it the largest NFT collection across all blockchains. The surge of interest follows yesterday’s announcement of the beginning of season III, which will introduce female DeGods NFTs, get rid of unpopular NFT traits and offer DeGods holders four generative art pieces.

“DeGods Season III was finally fully announced and received a very poor response from the community. Instead of offering a free mint, or even affordable mint, the cost to upgrade your existing NFT to the new Season III art is 333 $DUST, which is around 0.4 ETH,” said Yehudah Petscher, NFT strategist for Forkast Labs.

“When projects like the CyberKongz fail to sell out at 0.25 ETH and are told that’s too expensive in this market, it’s hard to imagine who would think 0.4 ETH would work right now.”

Polygon-native NFT collection DraftKings remained the second-largest collection by 24-hour sales volume for a second day, but fell 11.32% to US$1.15 million, as Polygon remained the second-largest network by 24-hour sales volume, with NFT sales on the network down 14.81% to US$2.04 million.

DMarket, Gods Unchained, Sorare and DraftKings all represent a form of gaming, all are pretty affordable, and all have thousands of traders. This is what the future of NFTs will really look like,”  said Yehudah Petscher, NFT strategist for Forkast Labs.

Ethereum’s 24-hour NFT sales continued yesterday’s recovery, rising 34.58% to US$9.75 million, while sales for the largest Ethereum-native NFT collection, the Bored Ape Yacht Club, rose 1.06% to US$834,460. Its twin collection, the Mutant Ape Yacht Club, rose 20.19% to US$6541,420.

Among Forkast Labs NFT indexes, the Forkast SOL NFT Composite and the Forkast CAR NFT Composite were the only ones in the red for the day.

Asian equities fall, U.S. stock futures rise, despite concerns around the banking sector

Major Asian equities declined as of 4:30 p.m. in Hong Kong except for Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index that rose for the first time this week. Japan’s Nikkei 225, the Shenzhen Component and the Shanghai Composite all posted declines.

Investor sentiment took a hit after Moody’s Investor Service lowered the credit rating of 10 small and midsize U.S. banks citing funding risks and weaker profitability. The ratings agency warned that it could downgrade another six major U.S. banks.

Despite concerns around the banking sector, U.S. stock futures recovered during Wednesday afternoon trading in Hong Kong, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average futures, the S&P 500 futures index and the tech-heavy Nasdaq-100 futures all posting gains.

Traders now look forward to the release of U.S. consumer price index data for July, scheduled for tomorrow, to gauge the Fed’s future monetary policy decisions. Bloomberg analysts expect the core CPI to rise 0.2% in July, which would be the smallest monthly increase in the past two and a half years.",Solana

XRP leads decline as top 10 cryptos drop
Bitcoin was little changed during afternoon trading in Asia, trading at US$29,010 as of 4:30 p.m. in Hong Kong after it fell below the US$30,000 support level on July 24.


Ether rose 0.32% during afternoon trading in Asia to US$1,832 and declined 1.94% during the past week.

“Investor sentiment in the crypto space is currently influenced by a lack of positive catalysts and a prevailing fear of increased regulatory scrutiny,” Jonas Betz, crypto market analyst and founder of consultancy firm Betz Crypto, told Forkast, referring to the recent Curve Finance hack and Binance exchange’s legal issues.

“Beyond a lawsuit from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, Binance might also be facing fraud charges from the U.S. Department of Justice. These combined factors are fostering an environment of caution and uncertainty among crypto investors.”

In a breath of positivity for investors, Curve Finance recovered $52.3 million, or around 73% of the stolen US$73.5 million, on-chain intelligence firm PeckShield announced on Monday. But the first Curve-ETH exploiter has still not returned the remaining US$19.7 million worth of crypto.

In the crypto market, the XRP token was the day’s biggest loser in the top 10, after it fell 3.3% in the past 24 hours to US$0.6139, followed by Solana’s SOL token that declined 1.3% to US$23.08.

The total crypto market capitalization over the past 24 hours fell 0.31% to US$1.16 trillion while market volume increased 12.95% to US$22.69 billion, according to CoinMarketCap data.

Forkast 500 NFT index refreshes all-time low, Bitcoin NFT sales start recovery, Ethereum NFT sales extend declines
The Forkast 500 NFT index slipped 0.49% to 2,441.81 points in the 24 hours to 4:30 p.m. in Hong Kong and fell 3.76% during the week. The index declined to an all-time low of 2,438.71 points earlier today.

Bitcoin’s 24-hour non-fungible token sales continued last week’s decline, falling 17.79% to US$424,710 with the network slipping to the seventh largest blockchain by 24-hour NFT sales volume, according to CryptoSlam.

Ethereum’s 24-hour NFT sales declined 13.06% to US$10.23 million, but sales for the largest Ethereum-native NFT collection, the Bored Ape Yacht Club, rose 56.98% to US$697,324. CryptoPunks sales also rose 53.80% to US$177,238.

“NFT sales have fallen for five months straight so far, and last year around this time we had a six-month stretch that ran from April to October before we finally started to see an uptick in sales,” said Yehudah Petscher, NFT Strategist at Forkast Labs.

In the wider NFT space, Web3 game developer nWay revealed new gameplay of its upcoming NFT game Wreck League, which is developed in partnership with Yuga Labs and Animoca Brands. The game is expected to launch in the coming weeks, with both a Web2 and Web3 version.

Major Asian equities declined as of 4:30 p.m. in Hong Kong, except Japan’s Nikkei 225. Yet, Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index, the Shenzhen Component and the Shanghai Composite all posted declines.

Investors were anticipating the release of China’s trade figures for last month, with concerns that both exports and imports could extend declines due to a lack of domestic and overseas orders.

U.S. stock futures strengthened during Monday afternoon trading in Hong Kong, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average futures, the S&P 500 futures index and the tech-heavy Nasdaq-100 futures all strengthening.

Traders remained cautious ahead of the release of U.S. inflation data for July, scheduled for Thursday, as this can also signal the path for further interest rate decisions.

On the corporate front, investors are now anticipating earnings from companies like Palantir, BioNTech,  Lucid Group, Paramount Global and Beyond Meat.

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-over-hyped-cryptos-jettison-174414565.html,3 Over-Hyped Cryptos You Need to Jettison ASAP,"Currently, there are over 10,000 cryptocurrencies in the market, each with different objectives. Some aspire to become mainstream currencies, while others focus on providing affordable loans in developing countries. Certain cryptocurrencies aim to revolutionize the internet, while others have more playful purposes, like a coin protesting Elon Musk’s tweets or pet coins inspired by Dogecoin’s meme appeal.

One of the most overlooked opportunities is short-selling in the crypto market. Going contrarian on certain overvalued cryptos can be highly profitable. While shorting meme cryptos may seem risky, diversifying positions and avoiding leverage can mitigate potential downsides. Here are three cryptos to avoid in the current market.

Shiba Inu (SHIB)

Shiba Inu (SHIB-USD), originally considered a “Dogecoin (DOGE-USD) killer,” is now an independent cryptocurrency used for peer-to-peer payments and accepted by some businesses. Despite its popularity, it remains a relatively small market cap coin but has been gaining traction. People buy and use Shiba Inu as a digital currency.

SHIB lacks the vital elements for sustained success. Delayed Shibarium launch and underwhelming token burning cast doubts on its future. Meme coins like Shiba Inu have failed to meet expectations, leaving investors unsatisfied. 

The popularity of Shiba Inu can be a double-edged sword. While it attracts attention, the constant emergence of new meme coins diminishes its potential to remain a long-term favorite. The competition in the meme coin market poses challenges for Shiba Inu to maintain its popularity over time.

Pepe Coin (PEPE)

Pepe (PEPE-USD), a meme coin inspired by the Pepe the Frog internet meme, is overvalued at over $650 million despite claiming no tax, a redistributive system, and a burning mechanism. While some hope it could be the next Dogecoin, its prospects in the current market are doubtful, and it may lose popularity as meme coin hype wanes. Investors should be cautious about its long-term potential.

Despite its high trading volume and retail investors’ fascination, PEPE remains a risky meme crypto. While some have profited from it, the future is uncertain, and history shows that meme tokens like PEPE often experience significant crashes, potentially harming those who invest in them.

Pepe coin’s downfall is due to its limited practicality as a novelty meme currency. Unlike other meme coins, it lacks real-world value and innovation. Speculation and volatility drive its price, and legal issues may arise from intellectual property concerns. As a result, major exchanges might avoid listing Pepe.

Dogecoin (DOGE)

In a surprising turn in the past weeks, Dogecoin has gone from being the worst-performing to the best among the top 10 cryptocurrencies. The recent Twitter rebranding announcement by Elon Musk contributed to a significant increase in trading volume, up by 322% on July 24, and a 5.1% price increase for DOGE.

Dogecoin still has a loyal following, and some believe it could make a comeback. However, its price has dropped nearly 90% from its peak in 2021, and it lacks the utility and value offered by other cryptocurrencies like Ethereum (ETH-USD) or Solana (SOL-USD), making it less appealing for widespread use and investment.

It’s obvious that the value of this token solely depends on investor sentiment and headlines. As with other meme coins, its long-term value remains uncertain and unpredictable. Dogecoin is a risky proposition in the current market environment, and investors should exercise caution when considering investing in it.",Solana

Fast facts
The launch debuts Binance’s native token, BNB, for the first time in the country. Other tokens listed on the exchange include Bitcoin, Ether, Ada, Algorand, Atom, Avalanche, Solana and Dogecoin.

Binance Japan will initially offer spot trading services, yield generation through Binance Earn and access to the exchange’s non-fungible token marketplace.

“By offering regulated exchange services in Japan, we’re hoping to bolster the development of the Japanese digital-asset market. The country’s drive for technological innovation and growing interest in blockchain technology make it a fantastic place to build a robust and sustainable Web3 ecosystem,” Binance said in a blog post announcement.

The launch of Binance’s Japan subsidiary marks the exchange’s reentry into the country two years after receiving a warning from the local financial regulator for failing to comply with registration requirements. Binance acquired local regulated platform Sakura Exchange BitCoin in November last year, which has been rebranded to Binance Japan Inc.

The announcement comes as the world’s largest exchange faces increased regulatory scrutiny globally. It was forced to withdraw its crypto license application in Germany in July, a month after losing its euro banking partner.

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bitcoin-ether-extend-losses-most-093851727.html,"Bitcoin, Ether extend losses; most other top 10 cryptos fall","Bitcoin and Ether extended losses in Tuesday afternoon trading in Asia amid concerns of a potential decentralized finance (DeFi) contagion. Reports of a hack of the popular DeFi platform Curve Finance, and of an attack on the LeetSwap exchange running on Coinbase, added to investor tensions. Solana and Litecoin led the top 10 non-stablecoin losers.

Solana, Litecoin lead losses
Bitcoin fell 1.54% to US$28,931 in 24 hours to 4 p.m. in Hong Kong, bringing its weekly losses to 0.72%, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

Ether fell 1.68% to US$1,834 in the past 24 hours and posted a weekly loss of 0.89%.

“In the aftermath of the LeetSwap attack, which saw a loss of about 340 Ether, and the Curve Finance exploit that resulted in a theft of approximately US$41 million in cryptocurrencies, there has been a dip in the prices of Bitcoin and Ether. The market is currently digesting these events as investors wait and watch,” Rajagopal Menon, vice-president of WazirX, India’s largest crypto exchange by volume, told Forkast in an email.

Bitcoin and Ether prices declined after CoinDesk reported that LeetSwap said it is working with on-chain security experts to recover 340 Ether after PeckShield tweeted the exchange on Coinbase’s Layer 2 blockchain had been attacked.

“In the past, similar incidents have caused price fluctuations, often downward, due to uncertainty and fear among investors,” Menon said.

“The extent to which these events impact Bitcoin and Ether prices throughout the week largely hinges on the DeFi community’s response and the speed at which investor confidence can be restored. News of fund recovery or enhanced security measures could potentially stabilize or even boost sentiment,” Menon added.

Over the weekend, decentralized stablecoin exchange Curve Finance reported a security issue in older versions of Vyper, the programming language used for smart contracts. According to data from smart contract auditing firm BlockSec, hackers drained an estimated US$41 million in cryptocurrencies from the platform as a result of the malfunction, raising concerns about possible problems at other DeFi platforms.

Following the Curve Finance incident, there has been a marked decrease in the total value of locked assets on the platform, plunging from over US$3 billion to US$1.7 billion – suggesting investors are fleeing the platform, according to Menon.

“This episode underscores a critical moment for DeFi and Ethereum, potentially indicating a nadir with immense upside potential. It also raises concerns about the risk of contagion spreading across other DeFi protocols,” he said.

“This incident could serve as an impetus for lending protocols to initiate proactive monitoring of on-chain liquidity for every collateral type they accept, thus bolstering defenses against such exploits in the future,” Menon added.

According to a report from European alternative asset manager CoinShares, digital asset investment products saw minor outflows totalling US$21 million last week. Trading volumes for digital asset investment products stood at US$915 million for the week, compared to US$1.5 billion weekly average this year so far.

“93% of the outflows were from long-Bitcoin investment products, while short-Bitcoin saw its 14th consecutive week of outflows totalling US$3.1 million. This suggests investors have been taking profits in recent weeks, with the sentiment for the asset overall remaining supportive,” the CoinShares report said.

All other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies fell Tuesday afternoon in Asia, except BNB. Solana led losses, dropping 4.15% to US$23.49, although it gained 1.82% on the week.

Litecoin was the second-biggest loser in the past 24 hours, losing 3.15% to US$90.37, while rising 1.37% in the last seven days. Litecoin’s halving event on Wednesday is expected to cut the mining reward for each successfully minted Litecoin block from 12.50 LTC to 6.25 LTC, increasing its scarcity and potentially boosting the token’s price.

The total cryptocurrency market capitalization dropped 1.64% to US$1.17 trillion, while market volume rose 19.93% to US$32.26 billion in the past 24 hours.

NFT sales volume rise 
The indexes are proxy measures of the performance of the global NFT market. They are managed by CryptoSlam, a sister company of Forkast.News under the Forkast.Labs umbrella.

The Forkast 500 NFT index fell 1.14% to 2,508.18 in 24 hours to 5.40 p.m. in Hong Kong. The index has lost 5.43% in the last seven days and 10.39% for the month.

Forkast’s Ethereum and Solana NFT market indexes logged losses, while the index measuring the performance of Polygon’s NFT market edged up 0.21% in the past 24 hours.

Total NFT sales volumes rose 5.68% to US$18.80 million in 24 hours, according to data from CryptoSlam.

Sales volume on Ethereum, the largest NFT network, rose 68% to US$12.67 million.

Trading volumes on Polygon climbed 45.07% to US$1.09 million to take second spot in CryptoSlam’s rankings. Solana and Binance’s BNB networks also witnessed increases in NFT sales volumes in the past 24 hours.

“Binance has two projects making waves with AIWorld Nodes appearing in the top 10 multiple times this weekend behind their node sales,” said Yehudah Petscher, NFT Strategist at Forkast Labs.

“PLAYNFT, a watch2earn platform for content creators and fans, has also been driving NFT sales on Binance,” Petscher added.

Asian equities mixed; U.S. stock futures, European bourses drop

Asian stock markets were mixed on Tuesday. China’s Shenzhen Component and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng dropped, while South Korea’s Kospi and Japan’s Nikkei strengthened at the close of trading hours.

Private research firm Caixin Insight Group’s July manufacturing PMI for China released Tuesday dropped for the first time since April, missing market estimates and falling to its lowest in six months. Japan’s Nikkei 225 gained as the country’s unemployment edged lower in June as forecasted, marking the country’s lowest jobless rate since January.

India’s Sensex index at the Bombay Stock Exchange closed 0.1% lower on Tuesday.

“I was looking at the GDP growth forecast for China versus India and India is still stronger in terms of GDP growth headline into next year and beyond. So, China has more work to do in terms of providing more stimulus to its economy,” Dean Kim, head of global research product at William O’Neil + Co., told CNBC-TV18 on Tuesday.

“If they were to come out with more stimulus – that could be good news for the market and perhaps that could sway the liquidity over to China, but as we are currently sitting, I still see India as a good performing market,” Kim said.

U.S. stock futures fell as of 6.55 p.m. in Hong Kong, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average futures, the S&P 500 futures, and the Nasdaq 100 futures all in the red.

The Federal Reserve next meets on Sept. 19 and 20 after raising rates by a quarter of a point in July. Interest rates in the world’s largest economy are now between 5.25% to 5.5%, the highest since January 2001.

Fed Chair Jerome Powell last week reiterated the bank takes a data-driven approach to decide interest rate policy and Fed economists said the likelihood of a recession in the U.S. has diminished, indicating to some analysts the Fed may leave rates unchanged next month.

The CME FedWatch Tool predicts a 82.5% chance the Fed will keep rates as is in September, and a 17.5% chance for another 25-basis-point increase.

“The complication would come next year, if both headline and core inflation rates get stuck at around 3%. Real rates will stop rising, putting the Fed in a bind as its 2% inflation target would remain elusive,” Singapore’s DBS Bank said in a research report on Monday.

“Resuming rate hikes would be very challenging, as by then economic growth would be 1%, if not lower, as per our forecast,” the report added.

European bourses started the month in red, with both the benchmark STOXX 600 and Germany’s DAX 40 losing during afternoon trading hours in Europe.

Last week, the European Central Bank (ECB) increased its key interest rates by 25 basis points to 3.75%, its highest level since 2001.

“While there is some indication of inflation easing in the Eurozone, the situation is far more uncomfortable for the ECB than it is for the Fed,” according to the DBS report.

“We are sure that the ECB would not want to undermine sentiments at a time when the economy is slowing, but we also recognize that it is in no position to give dovish signals. Either through further rate hikes or through disinflation, real rates have only one way to go in the Euro area, and that is up.”",Solana
https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bitcoin-ether-little-changed-market-014809631.html,"Bitcoin, Ether drop in Asia afternoon trading amid DeFi hack reports; most other leading tokens decline","Bitcoin and Ether prices fell in early Tuesday afternoon trading in Asia, with Bitcoin losing support at US$29,000, amid concern about the hack of the popular decentralized finance platform Curve Finance over the weekend that saw an estimated US$41 million stolen and raised concerns about a DeFi contagion. The hack has been linked to a flaw in a programming language. These concerns increased as reports surfaced on Tuesday of an attack on the LeetSwap exchange running on Coinbase. Solana and Matic led the top 10 losers mid Tuesday. Litecoin also gave up gains ahead of its halving event on Wednesday.

Bitcoin, Ether hold steady
Bitcoin fell 1.8% in the last 24 hours to US$28,872 as of 12:50 p.m. in Hong Kong, according to data from CoinMarketCap.


The world’s largest cryptocurrency fell under the US$30,000 support floor in the latter weeks of July and has fluctuated around US$29,000 since then, unable to find buying support for a breakout in the so-called summer doldrums when trading in many capital markets slows.

However, drama came over the weekend when decentralized stablecoin exchange Curve Finance reported a security issue in older versions of Vyper, the programming language used for smart contracts.

According to data from smart contract auditing firm BlockSec, hackers drained an estimated US$41 million in cryptocurrencies from the platform as a result of the malfunction, raising concerns about possible problems at other DeFi platforms.

Curve Finance is the third largest decentralized financial exchange (DEX) by 7-day trading volume, according to DeFi data tracker DefiLlama.

Bitcoin and Ether lost ground as CoinDesk reported that LeetSwap said its working with on-chain security experts to recover 340 Ether after PeckShield tweeted the exchange on Coinbase’s Layer 2 blockchain had been attacked.

In earlier comments related to the Curve hack, Justin d’Anethan at Hong Kong-based crypto market maker Keyrock said Bitcoin had held up well considering.

“Indeed, after the Vyper hacks that affected a number of pools in Curve and pushed prices of CRV, CVX and FXS along with other yield protocols down, BTC and ETH held steady,” he said before reports of the LeetSwap exploit.

Lackluster trading and caution is seen elsewhere in crypto asset investment products, which saw minor outflows of US$21 million last week, 93% of which were from long-Bitcoin investment products, according to an emailed report from European alternative asset manager CoinShares.

“This suggests investors have been taking profits in recent weeks, with the sentiment for the asset overall remaining supportive,” the CoinShares report said.

Nigel Green, the CEO and founder of the deVere investment advisory group, said summer typically ushers in reduced market activity, which in turn can create price inefficiencies and increased volatility.

“When used effectively and efficiently, volatility can be an extremely powerful investment tool as you can enhance your portfolios with high quality assets at lower entry points,” Green said in email comments.

“Not only does Bitcoin remain one of the best performing asset classes of the decade, I believe its performance will further strengthen. Both institutional and retail investors are increasingly seeing the value of a digital, global, borderless and tamper-proof currency and store of value.

“This trend will increase as adoption picks up further and as confidence grows again in the global economy.”

Ether, the second largest crypto token by market cap, fell 2.10% to US$1,825 early Tuesday afternoon after trading flat in the morning.

All other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies fell Tuesday morning. Solana led the losers, dipping 4.6% to US$23.31, while Matic was close behind with a drop of 4.1% to US$0.67.

Litecoin fell 3.5% to US$89.83, barely holding a gain of 1% for the last week ahead of its halving event on Wednesday.

The halving is expected to cut the mining reward for each successfully minted Litecoin block from 12.50 LTC to 6.25 LTC, increasing its scarcity and potentially triggering a rise in the token’s price. Litecoin is up about 31% year to date.

The total crypto market capitalization fell 1.8% in the past 24 hours to US$1.16 trillion, while trading volume rose 17.6% to US$30.83 billion.

NFT 500 ends July in red
The indexes are proxy measures of the performance of the global NFT market. They are managed by CryptoSlam, a sister company of Forkast.News under the Forkast.Labs umbrella.

The Forkast 500 NFT index fell 1.19% in the past 24 hours to 2,516.20 as of 7:45 a.m. in Hong Kong, resulting in a drop of 5.37% for the week and 10.70% for the month.

Forkast’s Ethereum, Solana and Cardano NFT market indexes all logged losses, while the index measuring the performance of Polygon’s NFT market edged up a slight 0.18%.

Total NFT trading volume fell 2.93% in the past 24 hours to US$17.65 million, according to data from CryptoSlam. Volume on Ethereum, the largest NFT network, declined 10.17% to US$11.68 million.

Trading volumes on Polygon jumped 87.67% to US$1.14 million to take second spot in Cryptoslam’s rankings. Solana and BNB networks also saw increases in NFT volumes.

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-under-radar-cryptos-buy-172445256.html,3 Under-the-Radar Cryptos to Buy Now and Hold Forever,"There’s no shortage of under-the-radar cryptos this year, as the appreciation of the broader crypto market was mostly driven by the top projects. In my opinion, this is healthy as it implies that more people realize the risks of investing in new projects.

However, there are exceptions among new projects. Some hidden gems exist outside of the big caps that continue to stay under the radar. If you’re a risk taker looking for more upside, these investments can deliver multibagger returns if they start getting recognition. Of course, caution is advised as they can also be easily manipulated and carry high risk-reward ratios. For this reason, I also recommend against putting in a meaningful amount of money and encourage individuals to invest accordingly.


That said, here are the three top under-the-radar cryptos:

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

Nano (XNO-USD)
Cryptocurrency stock image

Nano (XNO-USD) supports fast, feeless and eco-friendly. In simple terms, Nano uses a block-lattice data structure that allows wallet accounts to have their own blockchain. This gives the network infinite scalability. It also uses a unique system for verifying transactions and restricting any attacks on the network. As the website states:

“…Nano uses a unique consensus mechanism called Open Representative Voting (ORV). In ORV, user-selected representative nodes vote on each transaction, and every node (representative or not) independently cements each transaction after seeing enough representative votes to achieve quorum. Since Nano transactions are processed individually and asynchronously, deterministic finality (irreversible, full-settlement) is achieved in a short period of time, typically less than 1 second…”

Thus, one could argue that Nano is similar to Bitcoin Cash (BCH-USD), which recently experienced a significant price surge. I believe it could potentially follow in Bitcoin Cash’s footsteps, as it offers an even faster and cheaper alternative for peer-to-peer payments.

Storj (STORJ-USD)

Storj (STORJ-USD) is a blockchain-based cloud storage platform that offers censorship-resistant data storage solutions at a comparatively discounted rate. Simply put, Storj is a peer-to-peer marketplace where users can rent each other’s unused cloud storage space. Further, users can then encrypt their data to be distributed across a network of storage nodes to provide extra privacy and data availability. Once blockchain cloud storage becomes more tested, I believe Storj will expand into institutional storage as well. 

The caveat is that Storj is often overshadowed by its bigger peer, Filecoin (FIL-USD). While Filecoin has a larger market cap  and trading volume, I believe Storj is a better long term investment. The biggest drawback is Filecoin’s high inflation rate, currently around 80% annually. In contrast, Storj has minimal inflation.

As I’ve said before, blockchain cloud storage needs more time to start being widely adopted. Storj’s low inflation makes it one of my top under-the-radar cryptos in this sector. As more investors realize this, I believe Storj can swipe away much of the capital flowing into Filecoin.

Aleph Zero (AZERO-USD) is a privacy-enhancing, proof-of-stake public blockchain with instant finality. It is built on a novel directed acyclic graph (DAG)-based consensus protocol that has been peer-reviewed and presented at an ACM conference.

The project claims to have solved the “scalability trilemma,” which refers to the trade-off between security, scalability and decentralization in blockchain design. Indeed, it boasts high throughput and low latency and has privacy features based on secure multi-party computation (sMPC) and zero-knowledge proofs (ZKP). However, it has one part of that triangle lacking, which I will discuss later.

Simply explained, Aleph Zero is full of potential and utility and could emerge as the next Ethereum (ETH-USD) like Solana (SOL-USD) did in the last bull run. Solana is another high-performance blockchain platform that gained tremendous popularity and recognition during the crypto bull run in 2021.

Aleph Zero has very similar properties, and I think it could potentially replicate Solana’s success. Aleph also has some unique features that set it apart, such as its interoperability with other blockchains. One caveat is that it does not have a high level of decentralization. Aleph Zero currently has only 125 “era” validators on its network, compared to over 853,000 on Ethereum 2.0. That’s why, unfortunately, Aleph Zero does not truly solve the scalability trilemma.

Nevertheless, Aleph Zero could still deliver impressive returns if its pros start to outweigh this caveat in the eyes of the market. I believe that’s the case, but time will tell.",Solana
https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bitcoin-ether-edge-fed-raises-015856136.html,"Bitcoin, Ether edge up after Fed raises interest rates as expected; Solana leads winners","Bitcoin gained Thursday morning in Asia, but not enough to break through resistance at US$29,500 after the Federal Reserve raised interest rates by the expected quarter point. The bank left the door open for another increase in September. Ether moved higher with most top 10 cryptocurrencies. Solana led the winners as its trading volume more than doubled in the past 24 hours. Dogecoin led the losers as the meme token lost some steam after gaining over 11% for the week. The Forkast 500 NFT index traded flat and U.S. equity futures were mixed, reflecting the same performance on Wall Street on Wednesday.

Top cryptos gain
Bitcoin rose 0.90% in the last 24 hours to US$29,459 as of 07:15 a.m. in Hong Kong, but was still down 1.37% for the week, according to data from CoinMarketCap. The world’s largest cryptocurrency briefly breached US$29,600 early Thursday morning.


Ether moved up 0.88% to US$1,874, but remained 0.68% lower for the seven-day period.

The marginal gains followed the Fed’s decision to raise benchmark lending rates in the U.S. to between 5.25% and 5.50%, the highest in 22 years, to slow inflation. In a press conference, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said another rate hike in September is possible, but said decisions will be determined by the data at the time.

“An interesting time for crypto markets although you wouldn’t be able to tell when looking at the price action. With macro markets timidly risk-on, BTC and ETH rose slightly to recoup levels lost earlier this week,” said Justin d’Anethan, head of APAC business development at Belgium-based crypto market maker Keyrock.

With the exception of Dogecoin, all other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies traded higher in the past 24 hours.

Solana’s SOL led the winners, jumping 9.51% to US$25.35, but still sitting on a 3.80% loss for the full week. The token’s 24-hour trading volume surged more than 100% to over US$682 million, surpassing that of Ether and indicating investors are betting on a strong rebound.

“SOL’s price increased by about 49% in the past month, primarily driven by the stable development and progress of Solana’s blockchain and ecosystem, with steady growth in user base and restoration of reputation,” said Greta Yuan, head of research at Hong Kong-based digital asset exchange VDX.

Dogecoin lost ground after being the darling of the week as the rebranding of Twitter raised speculation it could be part of a payments system on the social media network. It fell 3.52% to US$0.0784, though is still holding a weekly gain of 11.82%.

The total crypto market capitalization gained 0.85% in the past 24 hours to US$1.19 trillion, while trading volume rose 20.51% to US$30.91 billion.

Elsewhere, Worldcoin, a cryptocurrency and digital identity project founded by OpenAI chief executive officer Sam Altman, issued its controversial WLD token on Monday and prices soared. The token dipped 1.49% to US$2.28 on Thursday, but is up 36.30% since the launch.

“OpenAI co-founder Sam Altman’s Worldcoin project might just be one of the most ambitious cryptocurrency projects in recent years,” Louis Schoeman, managing director at Dubai-based trading information platform Forex Suggest, said in emailed comments.

“The project’s core offering, its World ID, requires users to prove via an iris scan that they are human, and not an AI bot. Those who sign up will receive Worldcoin’s cryptocurrency token WLD,” said Schoeman.

“This sort of digital ID will be necessary in the development of AI, in order to tell the difference between humans and AI bots online. It’s becoming increasingly difficult to distinguish fiction from reality, which is a particular concern in the financial and democratic systems. Worldcoin wants to defend people from AI misinformation and make it clear who and what to trust online,” added Schoeman.

In emailed comments on Worldcoin, Michael Silberberg, head of investor relations at the U.S.-based crypto hedge fund AltTab Capital, said: “The value of a real non-transferable, and cryptographically secure identity is potent as it could reduce digital fraud, help bank the unbanked, and even reduce the number of times I have to convince robots I’m not a robot a day.”

According to reports, the Worldcoin project signed up more than two million users during beta testing and is now expanding operations to 35 cities across 20 countries, but the US isn’t yet one of them, said Schoeman.

“Altman made it clear the company didn’t feel the US would make or break the project, but with North America said to account for around 18% of the total world crypto value received, breaking into the US market will be a major concern for Worldcoin,” he said.

“A global digital ID enabling private identity verifications is undeniably revolutionary, however, it’s certain to stir up controversy, with many already calling the exchange of biometric data for crypto tokens an outlandish bribe,” said Schoeman.

Forkast 500 flat, Sotheby’s NFT auction sells out
The indexes are proxy measures of the performance of the global NFT market. They are managed by CryptoSlam, a sister company of Forkast.News under the Forkast.Labs umbrella.

The main Forkast 500 NFT index edged up a slight 0.57% in the past 24 hours to 2,651.39 as of 10:00 a.m. in Hong Kong. It’s still down 2.22% for the week. Forkast’s Ethereum, Solana, Polygon and Cardano NFT market indexes all logged losses.

While the overall NFT market remains in the doldrums, auction house Sotheby’s NFT art collections are attracting buyers of so-called generative art, or the process of algorithmically generating art forms.

Themes and Variations, an NFT collection of 500 generative artworks by artist Vera Molnár, was sold out within an hour in a Dutch auction on Wednesday for 631 ETH (US$1.2 million). It is the first collection in Sotheby’s Gen Art Program, which aims to spotlight three generative artists each year.

With secondary markets included, the trading volume of  Themes and Variations has totaled over US$2 million, according to data from CryptoSlam, making it the top NFT collection by that measure in the past 24 hours.

“In the future we’re going to look back at this time in NFTs as a very special time for generative art,” said Yehudah Petscher, NFT Strategist at Forkast Labs. “Art is still the best use case for NFTs, and it’s exciting to see so many collectors appreciating it even in a market like this,” he said.

“I’m expecting to see a rather steady stream of higher-end generative art from Sotheby’s, whose new generative art platform is using the Art Blocks Engine to produce these on-chain works,” added Petscher.

Total NFT trading volume dropped 5.16% in the past 24 hours to US$18.41 million, according to data from CryptoSlam.  Volumes on the Ethereum, Polygon, Bitcoin and Cardano blockchains fell, while Solana, Mythos Chain and Immutable X saw an increase in trading.

“Mythos Chain and ImmutableX are also up 47% and 69%, showing yet again that gaming NFTs (from Gods Unchained, CS:GO, TF2, DOTA 2) are another perfect use case for NFTs,” said Petscher.

Elsewhere, social media platform Reddit launched the latest series of its NFT collectible avatars on early Thursday.

Entitled “Retro Reimagined”, the collection features designs from both independent artists and NFT developers like Cool Cats. Unlike ordinary NFTs, Reddit’s collectible avatars are purchased with fiat currencies through a Reddit platform at fixed prices, but can be transferred to a third-party crypto wallet as NFTs.",Solana
https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bitcoin-price-falls-heads-weekly-020452083.html,"Bitcoin price falls, heads for weekly loss; Ether flat, Matic leads gainers, Solana the losers","Bitcoin fell on Friday morning in Asia as other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies traded mixed. Bitcoin again slipped below support at US$30,000 after a week that saw buyers retreat. Developments in applications for Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) failed to generate fresh investment, though some commentators say the pent up demand is there. Ether traded flat and is also a loser for the week. Matic led the early gainers on Friday, but is also in the red for the week.

Bitcoin backs off
Bitcoin fell 0.18% to US$29,824.09 as of 6:40 a.m. in Hong Kong, according to data from CoinMarketCap. The world’s largest cryptocurrency has lost 4.53% in the past seven days.


The drop came amid further developments in Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) applications by U.S. asset managers.

Spot Bitcoin ETF applications from BlackRock, Fidelity, Invesco Galaxy, VanEck, and WisdomTree on July 19 were published in the Federal Register, which means the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) now has up to 240 days to accept or request the applications, according to Bloomberg.

Bloomberg research analyst James Seyffart wrote on Twitter that while this sets the clock ticking, the SEC may still reject all the applications.

BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, filed its spot Bitcoin ETF application on June 15, sparking a round of buying of cryptocurrencies on expectations more institutional funds will start investing in the asset class.

While that enthusiasm has faded, Alex Kuptsikevich, senior market analyst at London-based brokerage firm FxPro said latent demand for cryptocurrencies remains, although  “the momentum is far from euphoric.”  Kuptsikevich added that Bitcoin continued to find support this week on dips below $30,000. “A move to the upper boundary at $31,300 is most likely in this environment,” he said.

Asia Pacific institutional investors “remain constructive across the digital asset complex following last week’s positive news on [ETFs],” said Matt Long, the APAC general manager of California-based international crypto brokerage FalconX. “They are well positioned for further appreciation in markets,” said Long in an emailed statement to Forkast.

U.S.-based digital asset manager Grayscale Investments said in a Friday report that about half of Bitcoin’s 80% increase from December to mid-July relates to macro developments, while the rest is due to Bitcoin-specific positives.

“Crypto no longer behaves as its own ecosystem: Bitcoin and other digital assets are now more correlated with other market indicators,” according to the report.

“Since January 2023, Bitcoin has appreciated more than can be explained by the rally in tech stocks and fall in the US Dollar. We think this reflects idiosyncratic positives, including optimism about eventual spot Bitcoin ETF approval, as well as Bitcoin’s surge in March following stress in regional banks,” Grayscale said.

“Valuations are now more closely tied to broader macro trends, and more Fed tightening could be a headwind for higher risk assets, including both equities and cryptocurrencies,” the report said.

Back in Asia Friday morning trading, Ether edged up 0.31% to US$1,895.14, while falling 4.70% in the last week.

Other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies were mixed — Polygon’s Matic led gainers, rising 3.42% to US$0.7711. However, it posted a weekly loss of 8.46%.

Polygon Labs is currently working on developing Polygon 2.0, a series of updates to the blockchain that the company says aim to make network governance more open and inclusive.

Solana was the biggest loser among the top 10, declining 3.53% to US$25.49, amid a 0.72% weekly loss.

The total crypto market capitalization edged down 0.15% in the past 24 hours to US$1.2 trillion, while trading volume jumped 19.19% to US$37.15 billion.

NFTs fall; OpenSea launches swap feature
The indexes are proxy measures of the performance of the global NFT market. They are managed by CryptoSlam, a sister company of Forkast.News under the Forkast.Labs umbrella.

In the non-fungible token (NFT) market, the Forkast 500 NFT index fell 0.56% in the past 24 hours to 2,696.41 as of 08:30 a.m. in Hong Kong. The index gained a flat 0.01% in the last seven days.

Total NFT trading volume rose 1.62% to US$18.69 million in the past 24 hours, according to data from CryptoSlam. Forkast NFT market indexes measuring performance on the Ethereum, Polygon and Solana blockchains all dropped, while the Cardano index rose.

On Thursday, NFT marketplace OpenSea announced that it is launching “Deals,” a new peer-to-peer NFT swap function. The company said in a tweet that this will help users avoid falling victim to “sketchy DMs & websites” as OpenSea will provide the platform for users to directly engage with each other.

Yehudah Petscher, NFT Strategist at Forkast Labs, says this feature is “more significant than people may realize.”

“One of the primary ways people are scammed in the NFT space is through fake trades. Often, legitimate trade sites are spoofed, and then trades offered through there,” said Petscher. “Now collectors will be able to trade using a platform they’re already familiar with and trust, and the best part is there are no fees involved other than gas.”

Currently, OpenSea allows only ERC-721 NFTs on Ethereum from verified collections to be traded on Deals. To make a “deal,” a user can offer one or more NFTs in return for another user’s NFTs, where one can also choose to add wrapped Ether (WETF) as part of the offer. The user accepting the deal will have to pay gas fees, according to OpenSea.

“Easy to use, and hopefully will have a major impact on lowering scams. This was long overdue.” Petscher said.

Elsewhere, Yuga Labs’ Bored Ape Yacht Club topped CryptoSlam’s NFT collection ranking by trading volume, rising 3.80% in the last day to US$1.4 million.

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bitcoin-trades-flat-losing-us-010326223.html,"Bitcoin trades flat after losing US$31,000 peg; Solana gains; Polygon, BNB lead losers","Bitcoin and Ether traded little changed on Wednesday morning in Asia, while the rest of the top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies were mixed. Bitcoin fell back under US$31,000, but its dominance in total crypto market cap is gaining, a sign of market recovery. Solana added to its gains this week, while Polygon’s Matic and the BNB tokens led the daily losers list. Bitcoin Cash has taken the number 12 spot in the list of top tokens by market cap after its listing on the new EDX Markets exchange.

Crypto price pause
Bitcoin fell 1.0% over the last 24 hours to US$30,801 at 07:20 a.m. in Hong Kong, shaving its weekly gain down to 0.39%, according to data from CoinMarketCap. On Tuesday, the price of the world’s largest cryptocurrency reached US$31,371, its highest since June 2022, on the back of optimism about spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund applications by a raft of Wall Street heavyweights, including Blackrock.


The level of Bitcoin dominance sits near 50%, which is the highest since April 2021. Alex Kuptsikevich, senior market analyst at FxPro, says this price uptrend in Bitcoin is a typical market recovery pattern in which the most significant asset in the sector attracts buyers first.

“It will probably take about a year of Bitcoin price recovery before crypto enthusiasts start looking for one with higher risk, pushing altcoins higher and leading to a new wave of capitalisation swell,” said Kuptsikevich, in an email statement. He said he doesn’t see altcoins rallying before November.

Bitcoin’s recent price recovery was sparked by Blackrock, the world’s biggest asset manager, filing an application last month to launch a Bitcoin ETF and refiling it again after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) indicated it lacked details.

Several other U.S.-based asset managers, such as Fidelity Investments and WisdomTree, have filed their own Bitcoin ETFs, suggesting mainstream finance recognizes the Bitcoin opportunity and wants to offer clients the access to its price movements without actually owning the token.

Ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, looked to be on a run to break US$2,000 this week, but fell back 0.81% to US$1,941 today after a gain of 2.64% for the past seven days.

The other top 10 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization traded mixed to flat, with Solana leading gainers with a 2.0% rise to US$19.45. The token has surged 15.35% in the past week.

Polygon’s Matic and Binance’s BNB token were amongst the losers — Matic lost 1.99% to US$0.6981, though it’s still up 4.29% for the week. BNB lost 1.68% to US$242.83, cutting its weekly gain to 1.81%.

Altcoins have suffered from the SEC’s crackdown on tokens that they deem financial securities. Solana, Cardano, Polygon and BNB were among those that the regulator named as unregistered securities in its lawsuits filed against the Coinbase and Binance.US exchanges in early June.

While these altcoins have partially recovered after an initial plunge following the SEC suits, several trading platforms including California-based Robinhood Markets Inc., Israel-based eToro and UK’s Revolut ceased support or limited access to some of these tokens for their U.S.-based customers.

Bitcoin Cash climbed to become the twelfth largest non-stablecoin cryptocurrency by market capitalization on CoinMarketCap at US$53.8 billion. The Bitcoin spin-off is one of the four cryptocurrencies listed on EDX Markets, the Wall Street-backed, compliance-focused crypto exchange that launched on June 20 in the U.S.

Bitcoin Cash had a market capitalization of US$20.6 billion and was valued at US$106.34 on June 19. It has since surged 160% to US$276.87. It dipped 1.70% in the last 24 hours.

The total cryptocurrency market cap fell 0.80% to US$1.21 trillion in the last 24 hours, while crypto trading volume fell 22.22% to US$31.14 billion, according to CoinMarketCap data.

Azuki dents NFT sentiment
The indexes are proxy measures of the performance of the global NFT market. They are managed by CryptoSlam, a sister company of Forkast.News under the Forkast.Labs umbrella.

The Forkast 500 NFT index rose 1.28% in the 24 hours to 07:45 a.m. in Hong Kong to 2,783.58, but logged a loss of 3.17% for the week. The two Forkast indexes measuring the performance of Ethereum and Polygon NFT markets rose.

However, despite moderate gains in the indexes on Wednesday morning, the NFT market overall remains in a downtrend, said Yehudah Petscher, NFT Strategist at Forkast Labs, the parent company of Forkast.News.

“The Forkast 500 NFT Index reflects declining sales prices across collections on all chains, but it’s Ethereum that’s really dragging the market down with it,” said Petscher, pointing to the recent problems with the Azuki NFT collection.

“Azuki’s struggles exasperated the already struggling market … Azuki’s new Elementals mint was supposed to be a boom for NFTs and instead was a bust, becoming a catalyst that drove NFT collections down to all-time lows.”

Azuki NFT creator Chiru Labs debuted its latest Elementals collection last Tuesday, to much negative response from the community, who deemed it almost identical to the original Azuki collection.

While the team behind Azuki posted an public apology to buyers on Twitter, dissatisfied Azuki holders formed the Azuki DAO last week and passed a vote on Monday to launch a lawsuit against Chiru Labs, claiming the 20,000 ETH (US$39 million) the company holds should be returned to the DAO.

LegalDAO, the decentralized autonomous organization formed in 2020 by a group of legal professionals, said Tuesday that it will help Azuki DAO in the effort to claim the 20,000 ETH.

By NFT collections, Bored Ape Yacht Club topped the trading volume rankings on Cryptoslam with US$3 million, but the volume was down 18.97% on the day.

Mixed crypto
Bitcoin added 0.41% to US$30,730.25 over the last 24 hours to 6:30 a.m. in Hong Kong, according to CoinMarketCap data. After a jump that followed a raft of Bitcoin spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) applications in the final weeks of June, the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization has lost direction, adding just 0.61% over the past seven days.


The U.S. regulator that approves ETFs, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), on Friday indicated it was unimpressed by the Bitcoin ETF applications by financial heavyweights such as Blackrock and Fidelity Investments, according to a report by the Wall Street Journal.

Ether, the world’s second biggest token by market capitalization, added 1.49% to US$1,954.67.  It’s gained 2.65% for the seven days.

Solana was among the gainers in mixed early Asia trading for other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. The token rose 5.48% to US$19.43 for a weekly gain of 14.47%.

Solana is rallying after a raft of bearish indicators last week, with Solana-based non-fungible token (NFT) protocol Cardinal saying it was shutting down, citing “macroeconomic challenges.” The Revolut neobank and crypto exchange also reportedly told U.S.-based users last Wednesday that it will delist Solana, along with Cardano and Polygon.

The three tokens were among cryptocurrencies that the SEC named as illegally issued financial securities in its lawsuit filed last month against the Coinbase and Binance.US exchanges.

Vitalik Buterin, the creator of Ethereum wrote on Twitter on Friday that the tokens don’t deserve to be targeted.  “If ethereum ends up “winning” through all other blockchains getting kicked off exchanges, that’s not an honorable way to win, and in the long term probably isn’t even a victory.”

Litecoin led the gainers with a 6.37% increase in the last 24 hours to US$112.96. The token surged 27.98% in the past seven days.

Litecoin, which was created in 2011 as a hard fork to Bitcoin, was one of the four tokens selected to trade on the EDX Markets exchange, which is backed by Citadel Securities and Fidelity Investments. The other tokens are Bitcoin, Ether and Bitcoin Cash. The New Jersey-based EDX opened for business despite the crackdown on crypto from U.S. regulators.

The California-based crypto exchange Kraken was ordered by a U.S. judge on Friday to submit information about its users to the Internal Revenue Service in an investigation of underreported tax liabilities. The crypto exchange was fined US$30 million in February by the SEC for its staking services, which the federal agency said were an offering of unregistered securities.

Other crypto movers included Tron, which dipped 1.85% to US$0.07572, but gained 3.31% for the week. Binance’s BNB token edged down 0.31% to US$247.13, and Cardano’s ADA fell 0.13% to US$0.2905.

“Brutal weekend for NFTs,” said Yehudah Petscher, NFT Strategist at Forkast Labs, the parent company of Forkast.News. “It might be easy to point to Azuki’s Elementals mint as the catalyst still, but lowering average sales and floor prices in top collections prior to Elementals mint showed that we were on the cusp of another free fall.”

The Azuki Elementals collection began minting last Tuesday and sold out in 15 minutes, but left collectors disappointed as the latest collection looked almost the same as the original.

Azuki founder Alex Xu, who goes by the moniker Zagabond, met with its community last Thursday to address complaints about the mint and Elementals issued a public apology on Twitter, saying they “missed the mark” and that the new release diluted the value of the popular collection.

Solana Suffers During Bear Market
Solana and its ecosystem took a thorough beating during the recent bear market.

Solana quickly grew in popularity during 2021 for its high speed, which it achieved at the expense of network centralization. While a wide range of hardware can validate most permissionless blockchains, hefty technical requirements resulted in Solana’s validators mostly comprising data center operators.

After rocketing from $1.5 at the start of 2021 to more than $250 nine months later, Solana’s native SOL token traded as low as $8 in January, according to The Defiant terminal.

Solana NFT Activity Doubles In May

Solana’s DeFi ecosystem also crumbled, crashing from $10B in November 2021 to less than $1B one year later, fire tanking a further 70% within three weeks of FTX’s failure, according to DeFi Llama.

The Solana Foundation had invested hundreds of millions into the native tokens of FTX and other SBF-backed projects in addition to shares in the defunct exchange, meaning FTX’s failure resulted in heavy losses for the organization.

The crypto market is still dealing with the implications of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) declaring 68 cryptocurrencies illegally issued financial securities last week in its lawsuits against crypto exchanges Binance.US and Coinbase.

The list includes several top 10 cryptocurrencies — Solana, Cardano, Polygon and the BNB token issued by Binance.

U.S.-based trading service Robinhood Financial said on Friday it will end support for Cardano, Polygon and Solana from June 27. Robinhood had about 11.4 million monthly active users, with US$62 billion in assets under management as of Q4 2022, according to Investing in the Web.

Solana posted the biggest fall among top 10 crypto tokens on Monday morning with a 2.35% decline to US$15.48. The cryptocurrency has lost 30% of its value over the past week.

On Saturday, the Solana Foundation said it disagreed with the SEC’s classification of its token as a security, while stating it welcomes “continued engagement of policymakers as constructive partners on regulation to achieve legal clarity.”

Polygon Labs also posted a statement on Twitter Sunday which said its blockchain network and the accompanying cryptocurrency Matic was developed and deployed outside the U.S. “Given our focus on network security, we made sure MATIC was available to a wide group of persons, but only with actions that did not target the US at any time,” the statement said.

Matic gained 3.28% to US$0.6343 on Monday morning, but is down more than 29% over the week.

Cardano’s Ada token lost 2.23% to US$0.2727 in a 28.35% weekly markdown. Cardano developer Input Output Global (IOG) was the first to respond to the SEC’s claims in a statement published June 7. “The filing contains numerous factual inaccuracies and will not impact IOG’s operations in any way. Under no circumstances is ADA a security under U.S. securities laws. It never has been,” the company stated.

BNB, Binance’s native token, dipped 1.66% on Monday morning to US$235.59, losing 23% in the last seven days.

Last Monday, the SEC filed a lawsuit against Binance, its U.S. branch, and chief executive officer Changpeng Zhao.

“Investor sentiment across both digital assets as well as traditional finance appears to be in a holding pattern waiting for further indications from the U.S. Federal Reserve and other central banks as to anticipated interest rate movements in the third quarter of this year,” Nathan Simmons, chief compliance officer of Hong Kong-based digital asset platform VDX, said late Friday.

NFT 500 index falls, May transaction volume surges
The indexes are proxy measures of the performance of the global NFT market. They are managed by CryptoSlam, a sister company of Forkast.News under the Forkast.Labs umbrella.

In the non-fungible token (NFT) market, the Forkast 500 NFT index dropped 1.58% to 3,281.22 in the 24 hours to 9:30 a.m. in Hong Kong, adding to a 2.38% weekly loss.

The Forkast ETH NFT Composite index was down 1.17% in the same period, logging a 1.38% weekly decline.

NFT sales on Ethereum fell 10% over the last 24 hours to US$23.65 million, but gained 83.97% in the past week. Sales on the Bitcoin network dropped 31.9% to US$3.82 million, but still recorded a 30% weekly increase.

Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) and Azuki remained the two most-sold Ethereum collections. BAYC had the biggest sales in the past 24 hours of US$5.1 million, followed by Azuki’s US$3.4 million and Mutant Ape Yacht Club’s US$1.7 million.

Uncategorized Ordinals – recently popular Bitcoin Ordinals that are not part of an established collection – recorded a 45.24% drop to US$1.4 million in sales over the past 24 hours, but its seven-day sales gained 7.85%.

DMarket, a Mythos blockchain-based collection of gaming NFTs, continued gaining momentum with a 18.34% rise in sales to US$1.35 million in the last 24 hours.

Notably, the number of NFT transactions reached 8.9 million in May, the largest since February 2022, according to CryptoSlam data.

“Before we get too excited we need to understand that the NFT landscape is vastly different from last year,” Yehudah Petscher, NFT Strategist at Forkast Labs, the parent company of Forkast.News, wrote in a commentary on Sunday.

“Today, we have projects like DMarket’s gaming skins on Mythos Chain, which did over 2 million transactions in the past 30 days alone. Still, growth isn’t measured in just sales, and the May turnaround just might indicate that mass adoption is happening right under our noses,” Petscher added.",Solana

On Tuesday, Solana launched a ChatGPT plugin that lets users purchase NFTs, transfer tokens, and analyze on-chain data. The plugin can be downloaded from Github.


“Every developer building consumer-oriented apps should be thinking about how their app is going to be interacted with through an AI model because this is a new paradigm for telling computers what to do,"" Anatoly Yakovenko, the CEO of Solana Labs, said in an interview. “AI will make Solana more usable and understandable.”

Yakovenko said he expects that future versions of the plugin will be able to write smart contracts and deploy them on-chain.

Solana’s AI offering follows an extended downtrend for the project and its broader ecosystem. The network’s SOL token is up 80% this year but remains 92% below its 2021 highs.

The move comes as the rapidly growing sophistication of ChatGPT and rival large language models dominate headlines. The technology promises to significantly disrupt the labor market, unlocking new productive capabilities while leaving widespread creative destruction in its wake.

Battered Ecosystem
Solana was an early winner in the Layer 1 boom of 2021 that was kicked off by rising transaction fees on Ethereum.

Total value locked (TVL) on the network grew 20 times from $500M to $10B between July and November 2021, accompanied by a 600% rally in SOL. However, TVL has steadily cratered to just $266M since then, with SOL also plunging more than 92%.

Solana lost sizable market share to competing low-cost Layer 1s at the end of the previous bull cycle, with critics taking shots at the network’s persistent outages and poor decentralization.

Already among the web3 ecosystems hardest hit by the 2022 bear trend, Solana suffered yet another massive blow last November when FTX and Alameda Research collapsed, throwing the firms’ founder, Sam Bankman-Fried, into disrepute.

Bankman-Fried, a long-time proponent of Solana, made large investments in many ecosystem projects through his now-insolvent trading and investment firms. Several projects have since failed due to the firms holding outsized exposure to their tokens.

Grants Funding
Solana also announced a ten-fold increase in funding allocated to its AI accelerator grants program to $10M on May 23.

The program aims to foster the development of machine learning models interacting with Solana-based protocols. More than 50 projects have applied for grants since the program was initially announced one month ago. The grants are valued between $5,000 and $25,000.

“I think what would be cool is an AI plugin that you tell, ‘Hey, I want to do an NFT set with 10,000 images in this style with these traits’, and then stable diffusion generates the whole thing, mints them on-chain, sets up a Discord group, starts answering questions, and starts building out lore and stories. I think there's a lot of interesting, weird things that could happen.”

The Solana ecosystem is already home to several projects utilizing AI specializing in web3.

Hivemapper, a decentralized mapping application that distributes tokens to users that contribute to its map using a dashcam, launched an AI tool in April that helps to convert dashcam recordings into a visual map.

Also in April, MarginFi, a decentralized trading protocol, launched Omni, a chatbot specializing in providing information on Solana and its ecosystem projects. Context also launched a Solana-focused chatbot last month.",Solana

That's the message from the call-put skew, an options-market measure that reveals what traders are willing to pay to hedge or acquire an asymmetric payout from bullish or bearish price moves.

The three-month ETH call-put skew flipped negative early today for the first time since January, indicating a bias for put options expiring in 90 days, according to data source Amberdata and crypto exchange Deribit. Puts offer protection to the buyer against price slides, while calls do the opposite.

JULIA HYMAN: Binance's $4.3 billion payment has been approved by a judge as part of the plea deal the company and its founder CZ reached last year, making it one of the largest criminal penalties in US history against the world's biggest cryptocurrency exchange. Jared Blikre has been watching it and watching the effect on the crypto market. Hey, Jared.

JARED BLIKRE: Hey, Julie. We've seen-- and I'm watching Binance token right now. We've seen-- we've expected this ruling to come for a while. I don't know that it's much of a surprise. Down 1.63% today. You might be surprised to see the runup that it's had recently with the price of crypto here. Take a look over three months, and the token is up 61%. And it's interesting.

Now, CZ himself is expected to be sentenced in April of this year. And he may do about 18 months, which is a lot lower than the 10 years he could have been given. But that still remains up in the air. Also, Binance is going to have a court-appointed monitor for up to five years. I don't believe we know who that is just yet. But Sullivan & Cromwell has been floated as one of the top names.

But let's check-- let's take a look at what crypto has been doing aside from that. We can see bitcoin down 1% over the last 24 hours. And here is a three-month chart. This is a very bullish-looking chart. Managed to break to the upside here in February after consolidating all the way back to December of last year. And let's take a look at the five-year chart so we can see the price memory that we still have above. And basically, we're looking at this in here.

Most of the hard work has been done. But you can see there's still quite a bit of price memory, up to $60,000. Could be a little bit of a headwind there. You're going to need some more catalysts. But I think we get to $60,000, it's a sure bet we get to $70,000. And then you have $100,000 and those much higher targets inside. I'm sure we'll hear from Cathie Wood and the likes.

Now, I also want to check out spot bitcoin flows and also assets. GBTC, that's the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, that has by far the most, 23 billion. Then you have the iShares, a BlackRock offering, with over 5 billion. Fidelity's in there too, ARK, then it drops off. And just taking a look at the dollar amount of flows, which is right here, we can see Grayscale Bitcoin ETF, which did the conversion from its ETN status, that is down $7.4 billion. And then we've seen $5.7 billion into IBIT. And Fidelity's offering received $4.1 billion. Guys.

JULIA HYMAN: Thanks, Jared. Appreciate it.

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bnb-price-climbs-highest-since-201734897.html,"BNB Price Climbs to Highest Since FTX Crash Amid Airdrop Frenzy, Easing Binance Worries","BNB price climbed over $380 for the first time since Nov. 2022, and outperformed the broader crypto market.

The token is benefitting from fading concerns about crypto exchange Binance after last year's regulatory troubles, and web3 gaming project Portal's airdrop farming campaign for BNB holders.

Binance-adjacent cryptocurrency BNB {{BNB}} climbed to its highest price since the crash of FTX, leaving behind last year's worries about the crypto exchange's legal troubles and buoyed by an upcoming airdrop mobilizing BNB users.


BNB, the fourth-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, hit $387 during the day for the first time since Nov. 2022, gaining 7% over the past week, CoinDesk data shows. It outperformed the broad-market CoinDesk 20 Index's (CD20), which showed a slight decline over the same time period.

BNB is closely linked to Binance. It was issued by the crypto exchange in 2017 and powers the blockchain ecosystem BNB Chain, formerly known as Binance Smart Chain. The exchange also conducts a regular token burning scheme that reduces the outstanding supply of BNB.

While the broader crypto market rebounded last year, BNB's price struggled, sinking to a two-year low price last October as regulatory troubles mounted for Binance. most notably the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filing a lawsuit against the exchange, its CEO Changpeng ""CZ"" Zhao, and claimed BNB security.

""A lot of sentiment was around U.S. sanctions impacting Binance beyond just the U.S.,"" David Shuttleworth, research partner at Anagram, said in an interview via X direct messages. ""In many ways, BNB's performance is tied to the exchange, so if user activity and volume on the exchange suffered, this could spill over into the broader ecosystem of the BNB network.""

Pressure on BNB eased following Binance's settlement with U.S. authorities – paying a $4.3 billion fine and CZ stepping down –, and the token staged a relief rally as market participants' worry over the exchange dissipated.

Portal's airdrop farming
Rejuvenated activity also likely fueled the price action, as the latest airdrop frenzy has reached to the BNB ecosystem.

Binance introduced on Wednesday cross-chain gaming platform Portal to the Binance Launchpool, offering Binance users a way to benefit from the project's PORTAL token airdrop slated for Feb. 29 and also listing the upcoming token on the exchange. Users may lock-up BNB tokens or FDUSD stablecoins in Portal's liquidity pools to qualify for the airdrop.

Following the announcement, BNB holders transferred over $400 million worth of BNB tokens in 24 hours to Portal in anticipation of the airdrop, blockchain intelligence firm Arkham noted Thursday in an X post.

""TUSD is related to Justin Sun, and its market cap is constantly shrinking,"" Bradley Park, an analyst at CryptoQuant told CoinDesk in a Telegram interview. ""It is likely due to the potential impact of the HTX and Poloniex hacks.""


Park also pointed to Binance killing fees on First Digital's FDUSD trading pairs with ether (ETH), BNB Chain's BNB, dogecoin (DOGE) and Solana's SOL as another reason for the decline with the exchange not including TUSD as an option for staking new tokens on its Launchpad.

(CryptoQuant)
(CryptoQuant)
The spike in FDUSD volume, coinciding with TUSD's de-pegging, suggests a transfer to FDUSD for participating in the FDUSD launch pool and joining the Binance Manta launchpad, Park explained. The launchpad is a popular service that rewards new tokens to investors that lock up specific assets, such as FDUSD or BNB, for a period of time.

""We believe that TUSD holders sold as the Launchpad pool did not open, causing the de-pegging,"" he continued.

There have also been continued concerns over TUSD's attestations. However, a spokesperson for Techteryx, the firm behind TUSD, told CoinDesk that ""attestations continue in the ordinary course of business and any suggestion to the contrary is false.""

The spokesperson also said that Justin Sun is not a shareholder of Techteryx.

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-cryptos-buy-high-growth-000000211.html,3 Cryptos to Buy for High-Growth Portfolios in 2024,"Numerous cryptocurrencies for growth are waiting to be discovered by investors, but this requires looking past the marquee names such as Bitcoin (BTC-USD), Ethereum (ETH-USD) and others that are known to dominate the headlines. Sometimes, the best opportunities can be found where others aren’t looking.

Investing in these cryptocurrencies for growth is riskier than sticking to the names that everyone follows in the financial media. But by doing so, one can uncover hidden opportunities.


In this article, I’ve researched three coins that I feel could be potential multi-baggers in the future. These cryptocurrencies for growth have comparatively lower market caps and are positioned to deliver strong returns.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

So here are three coins for growth investors to consider.

Harmony (ONE)

Harmony (ONE-USD) aims to improve blockchain scalability by using a ‘sharding’ technique to facilitate the creation of decentralized applications (DApps). It is known for its high throughput and low transaction fees and has attracted a small but devoted following among users and developers.

One thing I like about ONE is that it has a blockchain network. It’s not built on another blockchain like Ethereum or Binance (BNB-USD) Smart Chain. This means that despite being a more complex project, it can potentially be appreciated to a greater level than coins built on existing network infrastructures.

It also pays to keep in mind that the upcoming Bitcoin halving event will occur in April, so we should expect these smaller-cap altcoins to appreciate the momentum leading up to this event and for a time afterwards.

Siacoin (SC)

Siacoin (SC-USD) is the crypto of choice for Sia, a decentralized cloud storage platform. Sia diverges dramatically from traditional cloud platforms as it uses blockchain technology to improve redundancy and improve overall security of users’ files.

What I like about SC coin is that it has built-in utility and a real-use case, which is more than can be said for the vast majority of coins on the market today that are minted purely for the developer’s profit.

Users pay in Siacoin to rent storage space, and hosts receive Siacoin as compensation for offering their unused storage space. The economy of Siacoin is moderated and enforced by smart contracts, controlling terms for pricing, uptime commitments, and penalties for losing data.

Numerous price predictions can be found online for Siacoin, and it currently trades below $0.01. These predictions range from $0.01682 to $0.0293 in 2024 and from $0.02262 to $0.0339 in 2025.

Although it may be difficult to pin an exact prediction for Siacoin, these estimates paint a bullish feeling amongst analysts, which makes it one of those cryptocurrencies for growth that investors should consider.

Aragon (ANT)

Aragon (ANT-USD) is a lesser-known project that provides a platform for creating and managing decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs).

ANT is undergoing a pivot amid the dissolution of its non-profit Aragon Association. The new entity will seek to address some of its central challenges with its former structure, namely “bureaucratic complexity, misaligned stakeholders, and failed attempts at modifying the governance model.”

Despite this short-term setback, it seems that ANT will still be an accretive investment for long-term holders.

ANT has a small market cap of roughly $250 million. So, it is positioned well to surge in value if the upcoming halving event is successful in drumming up investor interest in the coin.

One price prediction for 2025 predicts a yearly high of $ 13.93 for the coin, followed by a yearly high of $ 18.51 the year after.

DAOs are a unique idea that I think will become more popular in the future so ANT could be the winning ticket for growth-oriented investors.

""TUSD is related to Justin Sun, and its market cap is constantly shrinking,"" Bradley Park, an analyst at CryptoQuant told CoinDesk in a Telegram interview. ""It is likely due to the potential impact of the HTX and Poloniex hacks.""


Park also pointed to Binance killing fees on First Digital's FDUSD trading pairs with ether (ETH), BNB Chain's BNB, dogecoin (DOGE) and Solana's SOL as another reason for the decline with the exchange not including TUSD as an option for staking new tokens on its Launchpad.

The spike in FDUSD volume, coinciding with TUSD's de-pegging, suggests a transfer to FDUSD for participating in the FDUSD launch pool and joining the Binance Manta launchpad, Park explained. The launchpad is a popular service that rewards new tokens to investors that lock up specific assets, such as FDUSD or BNB, for a period of time.

""We believe that TUSD holders sold as the Launchpad pool did not open, causing the de-pegging,"" he continued.

There have also been continued concerns over TUSD's attestations. However, a spokesperson for Techteryx, the firm behind TUSD, told CoinDesk that ""attestations continue in the ordinary course of business and any suggestion to the contrary is false.""

The spokesperson also said that Justin Sun is not a shareholder of Techteryx.

""Recent community mining activities in relation to Binance Launchpool have been noted, leading to short term arbitrage opportunities which is part of the normal market dynamics and liquidity adjustment,"" they continued.",Binance Coin

Not only are interest rates predicted to fall, but also upcoming ETFs are speculated to be approved for some of the leading cryptocurrencies.

As the investment landscape improves, investors’ risk appetites will return. This will mean that one could enhance their overall (as well as risk-adjusted) returns by investing in these assets.

So, let’s now dive into the three crypto predictions to help investors make sense of the market.

Bitcoin (BTC)

The much-anticipated Bitcoin (BTC-USD) halving event later this year is all but guaranteed. Because there won’t be another Bitcoin, its maximalists will tell you there’s no need to use any other network either.

Amongst the most passionate and knowledgable, Bitcoin is held as the one true cryptocurrency. The rest are derided as failed projects or outright scams. This perspective has some merit. Blockchain technology inherently doesn’t contain its oft-advertised benefits of decentralization, security, or immutability.

An observant investor has seen countless hacks of protocols claiming to be secure but then led to the widespread financial ruin of its user base. User error, backdoors, coding mistakes, and social engineering attempts can all undermine the security of other networks. But not so for Bitcoin. It’s scrutinized by hundreds of independent developers, security experts, and cryptographers. Also, decisions can only be made via a unified consensus by those who move the network.

In essence, Bitcoin is the blue-chip choice for investors who want to own a highly stable and robust cryptocurrency. Further, current crypto predictions suggest that it could reach as high as $1 million per coin if the stars align.

Ethereum (ETH)

Ethereum (ETH-USD) is another blue-chip cryptocurrency choice. Analyst crypto predictions for ETH are also optimistic, with some suggesting it could hit $5,000.

Notably, investors should be wary of fortune tellers and also take crypto predictions with a grain of salt. Unlike the stock market, often debated to act somewhat rationally and therefore efficiently, the crypto market behaves much differently.

Far more information asymmetry with crypto exists than with stocks. (Bitcoin doesn’t need to publish financial disclosures or reports). So, people are more likely to act on the behavioral biases of fear, FOMO, and speculation than making educated assumptions.

Despite the inherent speculation of crypto predictions with ETH, the asset could surge in value, following a “positive development” in the establishment of an Ethereum ETF.

Like with a Bitcoin ETF, those who operate an Ethereum ETF could indirectly push up the price of the asset. This may happen since they may be required to hold a large amount, if not a precisely 1:1 ratio of Ethereum to its assets under management.

Also, we could see exotic ETFs if these crypto ETFs were included, such as leveraged, inverse, or volatility ETFs.

Binance Coin (BNB)

Despite the controversy surrounding Binance and Binance Coin (BNB-USD), it could still be a solid altcoin to hold.

Binance has shown some surprising resilience in the face of criminal lawsuits of its founders, China’s crypto crackdown, and more headwinds. Additionally, it’s maintained its position as the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume with an enormous margin.

BNB holds strong utility in the Binance ecosystem. It is used to offer discounts on trading fees, and also lets investors participate in token sales on Binance Launchpad. And, the company can be staked or used in various yield farming and liquidity mining programs within the Binance ecosystem, allowing holders to earn rewards or interest.

Due to the continued dominance of Binance and the strong use-case of BNB, this coin may continue rising in the future. Hence, it may be a key beneficiary of this year’s crypto bull market.

RACHELLE AKUFFO: Global authorities cracking down on illicit money flows in 2023 and crypto and fintech companies are paying the price. The groups were fined $5.8 billion for failing to curb money laundering and other financial crimes. That's more than the entire financial system last year according to a new report by ""The Financial Times.""

To break this down for us, Yahoo Finance reporter David Hollerith is here. So, David, dig into this for us because usually the argument is illicit funding could come from anywhere, whether it's crypto or traditional cash.

DAVID HOLLERITH: Yeah, Rachelle, so by the FTEs tally, crypto firms and other fintechs were fined six times as much as traditional financial institutions in 2023 for not having adequate anti-money laundering and sanctions checks in place. Now one thing I would point out is this is a huge difference in past years, especially, given the relative size of how much assets financial institutions have compared to all the assets in the crypto market.

I will point out, though, that this is only about anti-money laundering and sanctions violations. So there's a whole other gamut of fines that banks for example are paying-- did pay in 2023 that aren't included. I briefly checked out those numbers and it's actually still below this.

The most obvious takeaway for last year in terms of the crypto market or crypto firms and fintechs was this $4.3 billion fine paid by Binance, the world's largest crypto exchange. That was obviously a big part of the total. And that was after a multi-year investigation that US authorities had been leading into that firm's compliance.

And this is typically how the numbers work per year. When you're looking at these kinds of fines is that it's normally one or two large investigations that lead to such large fines. That being said, the puts and takes here-- obviously, there's a huge divergence about what would be expected per assets.

I would just point out that the financial institutions-- traditional finance as we know it is much more heavily regulated. In banks, many regulators practically live at the banks and they have much firmer controls in place. They also-- the banks which make up a good portion of these firms also have to follow much stricter laws such as the Bank Secrecy Act.

And that being said, also to just the maturity of the crypto industry is so young. That's another thing to take away. But growth also plays a role. So we'll also want to pay attention to that this year going forward, Rachelle.

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cristiano-ronaldo-slammed-1-billion-101716891.html,Cristiano Ronaldo slammed with $1 billion lawsuit for promoting Binance NFTs,"Soccer star Cristiano Ronaldo has been hit with a lawsuit for promoting Binance NFTs.

The plaintiffs are seeking damages in excess of $1 billion.

Both Ronaldo and Binance made ""deceptive statements,"" they said in a court filing.

Cristiano Ronaldo has been hit with a class-action lawsuit for promoting non-fungible tokens (NFTs) listed on Binance.


In a Monday court filing, plaintiffs said both the Portuguese soccer star and the crypto exchange had made ""deceptive statements"" to promote the ""CR7"" NFT collection, launched in November 2022. They're seeking damages in excess of $1 billion.

NFTs are forms of digital art stored on a blockchain. The asset class exploded in popularity in 2021 as investors piled into cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin and ethereum. Their value has since tanked and about 95% are now worthless, according to data from NFT Scan and CoinMarketCap.

Binance's CR7 collection features images of Ronaldo in seven poses. The forward, who now plays for Al Nassr in Saudi Arabia, pledged to ""change the NFT game and take football to the next level.""

The cheapest of the CR7 NFTs cost $77 when it launched ahead of last year's FIFA World Cup but is now worth just $1, per BBC News. Monday's lawsuit alleged that both Ronaldo and Binance knew their promotion ""targeted consumers unfamiliar with crypto.""

Ronaldo isn't the first celebrity to be sued for promoting NFTs or cryptocurrencies. In December 2022, a class-action lawsuit alleged that Justin Bieber, Serena Williams, Paris Hilton, and several other high-profile figures were paid to misleadingly promote the Bored Ape Yacht Club digital art collection.

Meanwhile, celebrities including legendary NFL quarterback Tom Brady and ""Curb Your Enthusiasm"" star Larry David are facing a separate lawsuit for endorsing FTX, Sam Bankman-Fried's failed crypto exchange.

The Ronaldo NFT lawsuit comes just weeks after Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao, better known as ""CZ,"" agreed to step down as part of a settlement with the US Department of Justice.

The crypto exchange was slapped with a $4.3 billion fine for violating anti-money-laundering and sanctions rules. The DoJ said it had failed to block transactions sending funds to terrorist groups including Hamas, Al-Qaeda, and Isis.

Neither Binance nor Ronaldo's management company immediately responded to requests for comment from Business Insider, sent outside normal working hours.",Binance Coin
https://finance.yahoo.com/news/where-crypto-goes-next-after-the-humbling-of-binance-210819375.html,Where crypto goes next after the humbling of Binance,"The $4.3 billion pact Binance reached with US authorities this week creates new complications for the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange. But crypto enthusiasts are breathing an audible sigh of relief, saying the deal lifts a lot of the uncertainty hanging over their industry.

""It's nice to wake up in crypto and not worry about what will happen with Binance,"" Matt Hougan, chief investment officer at crypto asset manager Bitwise, said on X, formerly known as Twitter. ""2024-2025 is going to be so great.""


The settlement, JPMorgan Chase analysts added in a note, ends ""potential systemic risk emanating from a hypothetical Binance collapse.""


Michael Safai, a partner with crypto trading firm Dexterity Capital, argued the Binance ""resolution means a path forward for crypto and confidence that the asset class won’t be enforced out of existence.""

The movement in cryptocurrencies and related stocks in the aftermath of the Binance announcement showed that investors largely shared that optimism.

Binance’s own crypto token BNB (BNB-USD) was down 13% in the hours after its settlement was announced — an illustration of its many remaining challenges now that it is under tighter government scrutiny — but then recovered on Wednesday as the prices of other currencies stabilized.

Bitcoin (BTC-USD), the world’s largest cryptocurrency, was up 1% in the 24 hours after the Binance announcement, while ether, the second-largest digital currency (ETH-USD), was up more than 4%.

The stock of another big crypto exchange, Coinbase (COIN), also rose more than 3% Wednesday on possible expectations that it may prove to be a beneficiary of Binance's troubles.

The bull case
The bull case for crypto is that the worst of its problems are now in the rearview mirror.

Bitcoin peaked at $68,789 in November 2021 but then crashed in 2022 as the Federal Reserve began raising interest rates and a series of firms imploded, including crypto exchange FTX in November 2022.

A widespread crackdown on the crypto industry followed. Regulators sued a number of big players, including Coinbase and Binance. Earlier this month a jury convicted FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried of defrauding customers, lenders, and investors.

Now investors are newly optimistic that the industry is poised for wider acceptance and regulatory clarity from Washington. They are hoping the Securities and Exchange Commission will soon grant approval for a spot bitcoin ETF, which would allow investors to get exposure to the cryptocurrency without having to own it.

BlackRock (BLK) is among the big-name money managers that have recently applied to launch such a product. Grayscale Investments is also pushing the SEC to sign off on the conversion of its bitcoin trust into a spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund following an August decision in its favor from a three-judge panel of the District of Columbia Court of Appeals.

The panel concluded the SEC had been ""arbitrary and capricious"" when it denied Grayscale's conversion application in 2022.

The next official milestone where the SEC must accept or reject approval for a spot bitcoin ETF is Jan. 10, although the SEC could approve applications sooner.

The 'end of an era'
There are some reasons for investors to be cautious, however. The SEC still has a series of lawsuits pending against some of the biggest names in the industry, including Binance and Coinbase, as it tries to force more players to register with the regulatory agency and classify digital assets as securities.

And the fact that Binance now has to operate with so much government scrutiny will certainly hamper what remains the industry’s largest crypto exchange.

It is ""the end of an era,"" said Yiannis Giokas, senior director of digital assets at Moody’s Analytics. ""With digital currencies becoming more mainstream and institutional players entering the space, regulations and enforcement will become stricter to ensure compliance and consumer protection.""

The Binance pact with US authorities ""marks the same inflection point that we saw earlier at the intersection of the dot-com and post-dot-com eras,"" Giokas added.

Binance pleaded guilty to criminal charges relating to money laundering, conducting an unlicensed money transmitting business, and sanctions violations. Its CEO Changpeng Zhao agreed to step down, plead guilty to violating anti-money laundering requirements, and pay a $50 million fine, while retaining majority control of the exchange.

Binance will also pay the largest fine any crypto firm has had to pay — $4.3 billion to various US government agencies — and operate with an independent compliance monitor for three years to ensure it meets its plea agreement terms.

While the full terms of its agreement with the US haven’t yet been unsealed, they are ""likely onerous, robust and extraordinarily invasive,"" John Reed Stark, a legal consultant and former SEC enforcement attorney, said over X, formerly Twitter.

What is known is that Binance now must review and report on billions of dollars' worth of transactions it facilitated for suspicious activity, including $898 million in trades between US users and sanctioned users based in Iran.

The mandate also entails Binance’s full cooperation ""in any and all matters"" related to the agreement or ""any other conduct under investigation by the government"" during the agreement period.

This will also likely become ""increasingly burdensome, cumbersome and challenging"" for the firm, according to Stark.

Its new CEO, Richard Teng, faces no small amount of challenges in charting a new direction for the company while correcting for past legal violations.

In the first 24 hours following the government's announcement, customers pulled a net $695 million from Binance, according to data compiled by 21Shares.

That was significantly higher than Binance’s average daily withdrawals yet far from the largest since the beginning of 2023.

Traders view the Binance deal as the ""industry finally turning a corner"" and putting ""to rest one of the lingering questions for crypto in 2023,"" said Dexterity’s Safai.

As for the future, ""be prepared for a slower, more sustained pace of growth in crypto,"" he added.

- Founder of Binance, CZ, pleading guilty to money laundering violations in another stunning blow to the crypto industry. As part of his guilty plea, Zhao agreed to pay a $50 million fine and step down as the company CEO. Zhao is one of the most powerful and influential figures in the industry. So what comes next for Binance and the industry? What tasks at hand are for the company's new head, Richard Teng? Let's bring in now Yahoo Finance's David Hollerith to explain. David, the details, please.

DAVID HOLLERITH: Jared, so now that we have this legal pact with the US authorities, Binance is going to be playing what we could say compliance catch up in a big way. It has about three years of transactions worth about several trillions of dollars in terms of customer volume that it needs to go back through.

Previously, part of these fines were that the company did not file suspicious activity reports, and it's got to go back and do that. And that's going to take a lot of time. And these reports are expected to lead to other investigations, which could complicate things for the firm if more illicit activity on their part is revealed. It could also make matters worse for the customers if any of the customers were also engaged in illicit activity.

The pact also that we saw yesterday didn't include or end Binance's legal troubles with the SEC. They are currently in a civil lawsuit with the SEC that came out back in June alleging that Binance violated investor securities laws, mishandled customer funds. And that matter is still at hand in court.

Finally, this $4 billion fine that Binance has agreed to pay based on analysis, third-party analysis from actually a director at Coinbase, it does appear just based on what can be seen through the blockchain that Binance does have enough money to pay this. So in the short-term, they are OK and they will not need to make any additional crypto sales, which is important for the market.

But I think largely looking forward under this new CEO, Richard Teng, who we haven't really heard from yet. He did make a statement yesterday. But reporters, myself including, are very interested to speak with him. He's going to need to prove in the coming weeks that Binance can continue its business model, it can continue to work now that it is playing by the full rules of anti-money laundering and sanctions laws under the US jurisdiction.

And so we're going to want to watch to see that and pay a lot of attention to Binance's market share. It was once held the majority of crypto market activity in the past. And now, we're really going to want to see if that's going to continue to shrink as it has in the past couple of months.

Binance, as part of the deal, will pay regulators and prosecutors penalties of $4.3 billion and also plead guilty to criminal charges relating to money laundering, conducting an unlicensed money transmitting business, and sanctions violations.


Zhao also agreed to pay a $50 million fine. He is barred from involvement in Binance's business until three years following the appointment of a monitor to ensure Binance complies with all laws, according to court documents. But he was allowed to maintain his majority ownership of the exchange.

""I made mistakes, and I must take responsibility,"" Zhao wrote on X, formerly Twitter. ""This is best for our community, for Binance, and for myself.""

The announcements on Tuesday represent the most high-profile crypto crackdown since former FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried was arrested and charged in 2022 with stealing from his own crypto exchange. Earlier this month a jury convicted him of defrauding FTX customers, investors, and lenders.

The message from these two cases, Attorney General Merrick Garland said at a press conference Tuesday, is that ""using new technology to break the law doesn't make you a disruptor, it makes you a criminal.""

Some crypto supporters hope the Binance settlement will allow the industry to move past some of its recent legal troubles — and regain the confidence of more investors following a dramatic fall in 2022 that wiped out several firms and attracted the scrutiny of regulators.

The deal lifts some legal headaches that had been hanging over the exchange for years, including a probe by the Justice Department and a civil lawsuit from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). The CFTC had accused Binance and Zhao of violating US law by allegedly breaching derivatives licensing rules.

The pact was also designed in such a way that allows Binance to keep operating. Binance’s Richard Teng said on X, formerly known as Twitter, that he had succeeded Zhao as the CEO and that ""the foundation on which Binance stands today is stronger than ever.""

But these charges don't end all of Binance's legal troubles. The pact doesn't address a civil lawsuit from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which sued Binance in June and alleged it violated securities laws, mishandled customer funds, and misled investors.

The SEC has also brought enforcement actions against eight other crypto exchanges for unregistered securities offerings or operations, including Coinbase (COIN), Kraken, and Gemini.

'CZ' and SBF
The deal completes a turnabout for the 46-year-old Zhao, a self-made crypto billionaire known across the crypto industry as ""CZ.""

He was born in the Chinese province of Jiangsu, north of Shanghai, and moved to Canada with his father when he was 12.

After getting a computer science degree from Montreal’s McGill University, and working for the Tokyo Stock Exchange, he started Binance in July 2017 with co-founder and former partner Yi He. It didn't take him long to gain a following.

The exchange launched in China by issuing its own token called BNB (BNB-USD). The coin, which customers used to pay for trading fees often at a discount, helped the crypto firm quickly gain market share.

By November 2021, BNB carried a market capitalization of over $100 billion and trading on Binance accounted for roughly half of the industry’s total volume.

Then the crypto industry crashed in 2022 as the Federal Reserve began raising interest rates and a series of firms imploded.

Zhao at that time played a starring role in the downfall of FTX, his rival exchange. As FTX experienced a liquidity crunch late in 2022, Zhao said publicly that his company was selling its holdings in FTX’s FTT token (FTT), which contributed to the sell-off.

He announced his firm had reached a nonbinding deal to buy FTX's non-US businesses in what appeared to be a bailout of his rival, but then backed out a day later after reviewing the conditions of FTX's business.

FTX filed for bankruptcy in November 2022. Bankman-Fried was arrested in the Bahamas a month later, setting up a criminal trial that captivated the crypto world earlier this fall.

'We continue to BUILD'
After the collapse of FTX, Zhao came under more scrutiny around the world as government authorities tried to rein in Binance’s activities and bar it from operating within their borders.

US regulators turned up the heat in the spring and summer. The CFTC in its suit cited the company’s internal chat logs to show Binance's chief compliance officer and colleagues were aware around 2019 that the exchange did not have adequate anti-money laundering controls.

The SEC in its suit cited a comment made by Binance’s chief compliance officer to another compliance officer in December 2018 that ""we are operating as a fking unlicensed securities exchange in the USA bro.""

As the cases piled up, executives began leaving. The company also laid off more than 1,000 of its workers.

Insiders became increasingly concerned about the possibility of a criminal case and there were reports that some were frustrated with Zhao's handling of the DOJ matter.


In July Zhao said over Twitter that ""Yes, there is turnover (at every company). But the reasons dreamed up by the 'news' are completely wrong ... We continue to BUILD, and continue to hire.""

'We got cake for you'
The Justice Department said Tuesday that what its investigation found is that Binance and Zhao spent years profiting from the US market without putting proper controls in place, feeling that compliance with US laws would put profits at risk.

It ""prioritized profits over the safety of the American people,"" Garland said Tuesday.

Garland cited internal communications showing that compliance employees knew Binance's procedures were inadequate.

One employee, he said, wrote ""'we need a banner ‘is washing drug money too hard these days - come to binance we got cake for you.'""


Zhao, according to prosecutors, knew that to comply with anti-money laundering controls might mean some customers would not use his exchange.

It was ""better to ask for forgiveness than permission,"" he told employees, prosecutors said.

That lack of controls, according to the Treasury Department, meant Binance failed to prevent and report suspicious transactions with terrorists — including Hamas' Al-Qassam Brigades, Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ), Al Qaeda, and the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria.

""Binance turned a blind eye to its legal obligations in the pursuit of profit,"" Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said Tuesday. ""Its willful failures allowed money to flow to terrorists, cybercriminals, and child abusers through its platform.""

JOSH LIPTON: Well, let me just get your reaction to these headlines. What did you make of the report?

HOWARD FISCHER: Well, to use the technical legal term, wow. You know, on one hand, ever since the SEC filed its original complaint about binance and referenced that binance was deliberately skirting US laws, deliberately skirting US compliance obligations and turning a blind eye to having US customers and US customers having transactions with sanctioned regimes and sanctioned individuals. Ever since that, it was a foregone conclusion that there would be some kind of criminal action because those allegations were criminal violations, as well as violations of the securities laws.

So on the one hand, given all of that, it's not surprising that this happened, but a $4 billion fine guilty verdicts on both a corporate level and an individual level, those are never not shocking, especially when the allegations are as outrageous as the ones in the indictment.

JULIE HYMAN: It's still also somewhat shocking that all of that can be true and he can still retain control of the company and it can keep operating, like, how do we sort of think about those two things happening and what do you make of the fact that regulators agreed to that part of the deal?

HOWARD FISCHER: Yeah. I mean, there was some concern in the industry that if there was going to be a criminal charge levied against binance and against individuals at binance that that would end up shutting down the company, and I think there was some concern about the disruptive effects that would have not just in the cryptocurrency world, but in the global economy writ large.

I think that in some ways, this has to be seen as somewhat optimistic for the cryptocurrency sector precisely because as, you pointed out, they're not shutting down the company. And by not shutting down the company, it's almost an implicit recognition that there is some role in the global economy and in the global financial sector for the digital asset sector to survive. So I think that ultimately, this might be optimistic for the sector.

JOSH LIPTON: But here's my question for you, and I go back to you as an attorney. If binance is allowed to keep operating here, is that an issue in terms of-- are there lessons learned for the industry after all this?

HOWARD FISCHER: Well, I think there are lessons learned. I mean, first of all, they are going to be very closely monitored and managed by the justice department and by others. So they're not going to be allowed to just keep operating as before.

Also, I think one of the things that's not said or at least not perceived yet is that by cooperating with the government and by allowing the government to have access to their operations, what binance is doing is allowing prosecutors to trace some of the improper transactions that they alleged occurred, which might lead to recoveries against sanctioned individuals. Might lead and probably will lead to future prosecutions and might lead to the tracing of asset flows to, as you said in the opening, entities such as Hamas or other terrorist organizations.

So I think by keeping it open, they do facilitate further criminal actions and further regulatory actions as well.",Binance Coin

- Founder and CEO of Binance CZ to plead guilty to criminal charges. Binance agreeing to pay billions in fines as part of the settlement with the Department of Justice. And here with the details, we've got Yahoo finance's Jennifer Schoenberger. We have been long waiting for news like this. Give us the details.

JENNIFER SCHOENBERGER: Yes, we have. Julie, the US government slapping Binance, the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange, with $4.4 billion fine and mandating that it exit the United States for violating US anti-money laundering laws and sanctions. In charges being brought by the US Treasury, Department of Justice, and Commodities Futures and Trading Commission, Binance violated the US Bank Secrecy Act by failure to implement programs to prevent and report suspicious transactions with terrorists, including Hamas, Al-Qaeda, and ISIS; failure to report ransomware attackers and money launderers; and for matching trades between US users and those in sanctioned jurisdictions like Iran and North Korea.

Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen saying in a statement, quote, ""Binance turned a blind eye to its legal obligations in the pursuit of profit. Its willful failures allowed money to flow to terrorists, cybercriminals, and child abusers through its platform."" To ensure that Binance complies with the full terms of settlement, Treasury will retain access to books, records, and systems of Binance for up to five years and monitor those.

Binance CEO, as you mentioned at the top, Changpeng Zhao, pleading guilty and stepping down on account of these charges and will also pay a $50 million fine. There is more still on the legal fight for Binance to fight. But for right now, authorities charging Binance, again, with a $4.4 billion fine for violating US anti-money laundering laws and sanctions. Back to you.

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/binance-founder-appeared-hint-stepping-195854423.html,Binance founder appeared to hint at stepping down in a post just 2 days ago,"Crypto exchange Binance has been under scrutiny from US regulators for a while.

""CZ,"" Binance's founder, will plead guilty, to anti money-laundering violations and will step down, the WSJ reported.

He tweeted two days ago about Sam Altman's situation at OpenAI. It seems prophetic now.

Two days ago, Changpeng Zhao — the man who founded crypto exchange Binance and who's known as ""CZ"" — tweeted about Sam Altman's current predicament with a strangely prophetic line:


""Knowing when to let go control of a company you founded is one of the trickiest decisions.""


Perhaps at the time, he had something on his mind more than just the OpenAI troubles.

It's almost like he was hinting at stepping down.

Now, on Tuesday — just two days after CZ's post — news broke that he was indeed set to step down as the head of crypto exchange Binance, according to a Wall Street Journal report.

He will also agree to plead guilty to charges of not complying with anti money-laundering regulations in the US. He'll pay a $50 million criminal fine, the WSJ reported; Binance itself will plead guilty and pay fines of $4.3 billion, the report said.

US regulators have been cracking down on crypto lately, and Binance, one of the largest exchanges and former chief competitor to Sam Bankman-Fried's FTX, has been under scrutiny.

CZ's reported deal with the government means if he steps down and the fines are paid, Binance can to continue to operate, the Journal reported.

Optimism's OP token slid 5% after the Optimism Foundation sold 116 million tokens.

BNB, XRP and other alternative cryptocurrencies nursed losses as market leader bitcoin (BTC) showed low signs of euphoria after a key Mt.Gox action was delayed another year, suggesting investors had likely priced in rumors of the delay.


The defunct crypto exchange Mt. Gox pushed the deadline for its repayments to Oct. 31, 2024. The exchange was hacked in 2014, which led to 850,000 bitcoin (BTC), worth nearly $23 billion based on current prices, being stolen.

Some investors expected these sales to influence the crypto market, given early investors were likely sitting on several multiples of their initially invested capital and had incentive to lock in gains.

In a broadcast message early Thursday, trading firm QCP Capital attributed bitcoin's recovery above $27,000 to rumors that the start of the distribution of funds to Mt. Gox customers has been delayed until 2024.

Bitcoin, however, failed to hold above those levels and slid to $26,900 as of European afternoon hours.

Major alternative currencies sold off Thursday as traders likely locked in gains from earlier this week. In the past 24 hours, BNB Chain’s BNB and XRP slid as much as 2%, ether (ETH) shed 1%, while dogecoin (DOGE) was little changed.

Toncoin (TON) dropped 8% after rising 35% in the past week, following messaging giant Telegram’s endorsement of the tokens. Elsewhere, ImmutableX’s IMX tokens rose 30%, dominated by South Korean trading volumes.

Layer-2 network Optimism’s OP tokens fell 5% as the Optimism Foundation said it had sold 116 million OP tokens, worth $157 million at current prices, to seven separate buyers. These buyers are expected to use their tokens to vote on Optimism’s governance forums.

Meanwhile, some traders said that data suggested investors were accumulating bitcoin in expectations of a bull market, even as the short-term bearish outlook remained intact.

“Long-term BTC holders are accumulating the coins they sold to short-term investors in the spring, which promises positive prospects for the future, said FxPro analyst Alex Kuptsikevich in a note to CoinDesk. “This is the kind of behavior hoarders exhibit at the beginning of bull markets.”

On-chain analysis firm CryptoQuant said in a note that current price action mirrored past cycles and displayed an accumulation period.

""Bitcoin's recent price performance closely resembles past cycles, suggesting that the biggest cryptocurrency is likely to remain in a consolidation phase until the 2024 halving event, but hinting at a significant price increase after the 2024 halving,"" analysts said.

""We're seeing a lot of traditional institutions that used to provide fiat ramp channels pull away,"" said Changpeng Zhao.

Zhao was speaking at the crypto event Token2049 in Singapore.

Binance CEO Changpeng ""CZ"" Zhao thinks a key problem in expanding cryptocurrency's reach is the lack of resources that help convert cash into crypto, and vice versa.


At Token2049 — a crypto event in Singapore that Insider attended — Zhao was asked about the challenges in bringing the next 100 million users into cryptocurrencies.

""Today, to be very frank, it's actually fiat ramps,"" he responded. Fiat ramps refer to a service that exchanges fiat currency like the US dollar into cryptocurrency — like Bitcoin and Ethereum.

""With tightening regulations in the earlier part of this year, we're seeing a lot of traditional institutions that used to provide fiat ramp channels pull away,"" said Zhao.

His comments come amid a mixed year for crypto.

Crypto exchange FTX's collapse last year saw the largest-ever withdrawal of Bitcoin from exchanges in November, amounting to $1.5 billion.

The Metropolitan Commercial Bank — one of the first banks to dive into cryptocurrency — said in January that it would pivot away from the business.

Then, in March, crypto-friendly banks like Silicon Valley Bank, Signature Bank, and Silvergate Bank collapsed. The collapse of these banks leaves crypto firms with fewer avenues to convert fiat currency into crypto assets.

Regulatory crackdown on crypto companies has also deepened in the US.

In June, the Securities and Exchange Commission sued the US's largest crypto exchange Coinbase, alleging that it had violated securities rules, just a day after it filed similar charges against Binance and Zhao.

And even though prices for Bitcoin — the most traded cryptocurrency — have risen since November 2022, at just over $26,000, they are nearly a third of a peak price of $69,000 in November 2021.

Even so, Zhao is among the wealthiest figures in crypto, with a net worth of $27.1 billion, derived largely through his stake in Binance, per the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. His exchange is the largest crypto exchange by trading volume in 2023.

A layer 2 refers to any off-chain network, system, or technology built on top of a base, or layer 1, blockchain. The OP Stack is the set of software that powers Optimism, an Ethereum layer 2 blockchain, that can be used by developers to create their own networks.

Developers said they tested more than 35 million transactions and deployed some 150 applications on opBNB during the testing phase. The blockchain processed a maximum of 4,000 transactions per second (TPS) in that period – a significantly bigger number than Ethereum’s current 17 TPS.

“Scalability and security are the top priorities of opBNB,” said Arno Bauer, Senior Architect at BNB Chain, in a message to CoinDesk. “Before opening the mainnet to the public, stringent criteria had to be met. This included High Availability (HA), 4K Transactions Per Second (TPS), rigorous stress testing, reduced gas costs under 0.2 gwei, fast finality under 1 second, and enhanced security with multiple external audits.”

OpBNB joins the increasingly competitive and crowded ranks of over 50 other blockchains.

Projects can integrate with opBNB through BNB Chain’s extensive developer tutorial and dedicated technical support. To kickstart network activity, BNB Chain said it would soon roll out airdrop incentives alongside fifteen ecosystem projects to attract initial users and funds to the upstart network.",Binance Coin

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/secs-secret-binance-court-filing-144955478.html,SEC's Secret Binance Court Filing Has Observers Bracing for Bad News,"A new secret court filing related to Binance, the crypto exchange that already faces U.S. accusations of wrongdoing, has some wondering whether more bad news is about to hit the industry giant.

On Monday, in the court docket for its case against Binance, the Securities and Exchange Commission submitted a sealed motion, which lets it file sensitive or confidential information without revealing the contents publicly.


The motion included more than 35 exhibits, a declaration from Jennifer Farer (an SEC trial attorney) and a proposed order.

A spokesperson for Binance did not immediately respond to a request for comment by CoinDesk.

Filing court documents under seal is a “rare move,” John Reed Stark, a former SEC official who now runs a consulting firm, posted on X (formerly Twitter). “After all, it’s in the public interest to know and understand the SEC’s use of U.S. tax dollars and the U.S. SEC wants its messages heard loud and clear to deter future securities violations.”

Stark offered two theories about what the SEC is doing: It’s trying to avoid interfering with a criminal investigation at the U.S. Department of Justice, or the SEC is worried about putting a witness or company at risk.


The SEC in June sued Binance on allegations of violating federal securities laws by offering unregistered securities to the general public in the form of its BNB token and Binance USD (BUSD) stablecoin.

“Under any circumstance, that this SEC seal-seeking filing is unusual, odd and uncommon cannot be overstated,” Stark wrote. “In my almost 20 years in the SEC Enforcement Division, including 11 years as Chief of the SEC’s Office of Internet Enforcement, our team worked on and led a broad range of SEC investigations which involved parallel U.S. DOJ investigations and lots of litigation – and I can’t recall ever seeking to file a motion or any other court document under seal.”",Binance Coin
https://finance.yahoo.com/news/binance-offer-t-3-daily-053349431.html,Binance to Offer 'T+3' Daily BNB/USDT Options,"Leading cryptocurrency exchange Binance said its trading division Binance Options will offer ""T+3"" daily call and put contracts tied to BNB, a cryptocurrency closely linked to the exchange.

Starting Wednesday, Binance Options will list the T+3 BNB/USDT options every day at 08:00 UTC. New listings won't happen on days longer duration contracts expire, the exchange said in the official blog.


T+3 refers to the obligation to settle securities trades by the third day following the trade date. In other words, users can trade the T+3 daily options two days before the expiry day. The options, therefore, will have an initial lifetime of three trading days at the time of introduction.

The new product will offer greater flexibility to traders and expand the exchange's existing product suite that includes longer duration BNB options and the T+2 daily BNB options.

The T+3 daily options will have similar specifications as other BNB options, with each call and put contract representing 1 BNB and expiring very day at 08:00 UTC. The contracts can be exercised only on expiry and will be settled in USDT.

Options are derivative contracts that give the purchaser the right but not the obligation to buy or sell the underlying asset at a predetermined price on or before a specific date. A call option gives the right to buy, while a put option offers the right to sell.

The launch of T+3 daily options comes amid heightened volatility in BNB. The cryptocurrency crashed to a 14-month low of $203 last week after the Wall Street Journal reported that Binance helped Russian users move money abroad, circumventing international sanctions. The report added to the mounting regulatory fears for the exchange.",Binance Coin

Mounting legal and regulatory scrutiny over the exchange and a large distressed BNB-secured loan has weighed on the token’s price.

Some observers allege that Binance might be selling bitcoin to keep BNB price afloat.

BNB, a cryptocurrency closely linked to crypto exchange Binance, fell to its lowest in more than a year following a news report regarding fresh risks over Russia sanctions added to already mounting regulatory and legal pressure on the company.


The token sank to as low as $204 earlier Tuesday afternoon, its weakest level since June 2022's crypto market crash. It's since pared some of those losses, currently changing hands at $205, down about 14% over the past week.

This latest decline happened after the Wall Street Journal reported that Binance was facilitating Russian users' ability to move money abroad despite widespread international sanctions.

The exchange was already facing sprawling regulatory scrutiny around the globe, including a lawsuit from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for multiple federal securities laws violations such as commingling customer funds and listing unregistered securities like BNB and Binance USD on the platform.

Risks around Binance weigh heavily on BNB, which is the fourth largest cryptocurrency with $32 billion market value and powers the BNB Chain network, formerly known as Binance Smart Chain.

Is Binance selling bitcoin (BTC) to support BNB price?
Further price declines could potentially impact the broader crypto markets, as some market observers have long alleged that Binance might attempt to prop up the token’s value by selling bitcoin (BTC). The exchange’s CEO, Changpeng “CZ” Zhao has previously denied such rumors.

Alongside BNB's drop this afternoon, the price of bitcoin (BTC) also declined to session lows below $25,800.

A looming liquidation of a crypto loan secured by $130 million worth of BNB on decentralized finance protocol Venus also adds pressure to the token’s price. BNB Chain is coordinating with Venus to dismantle the loan in an orderly fashion to avoid “cascading liquidation” and “unnecessary damage to the market,” according to a Venus governance vote.

The BNB Chain developer team liquidated a $30 million chunk of the outstanding debt on Monday, which somewhat helped ease liquidation risks, CoinDesk reported. Following the partial liquidation, BNB Chain received $30 million USDT from a Binance wallet, blockchain data on Arkham Intelligence shows.",Binance Coin

The position was liquidated manually by the BNB Core team after BNB’s price dropped below $220, as per a November 2022 governance proposal passed by Venus. The team chose manual liquidation to minimize the impact of the margin call on-chain, where a liquidity shortfall could have threatened to destabilize the BNB price and pose a contagion risk to BNB Chain’s broader DeFi ecosystem.


BNB last traded for $215.8 after sinking 38% since mid-April, according to CoinGecko. Venus’ XVS token is up 6.5% in the past 24 hours.

Binance Bridge Hacker Hit By $30M Liquidation On Venus
Binance Bridge Hacker Hit By $30M Liquidation On Venus
In October 2022, the hacker exploited the BNB Chain bridge and minted 2M BNB tokens before using 900,000 BNB as collateral to borrow $150M worth of stablecoins on Venus.

“Following today’s market movement, the BNB Bridge exploiter account was made healthy as promised by BNB Chain using whitelisted liquidation without any resulting shortfall or further impact to BNB,” Venus said.

Venus is the second-largest DeFi protocol on the BNB Chain network with a total value locked of $600M.

The incident highlights the trade-offs associated with the varying degrees of centralization offered by different smart contract networks, with BNB Chain’s willingness to intervene mitigating the risk of the liquidation causing further damage.

In contrast, Michael Egorov, the founder of Curve Finance, recently scrambled to pay down his debts on Ethereum-based lending protocols as the crypto community feared further drawdowns in the price of CRV could lead to nine-figure liquidations on-chain.

July 30 exploits targeting Vyper, a smart contract coding language used by Curve, sparked an abrupt slump in the price of CRV, placing hundreds of millions of dollars worth of CRV-backed loans at risk of liquidation.

With poor on-chain CRV liquidity threatening to leave leading lending protocols on Ethereum with bad debt, Curve’s founder sold off much of his CRV holdings significantly below market value via over-the-counter deals to pay down his loans.",Binance Coin

On Aug. 10, Binance announced it will deploy opBNB on mainnet this month, meaning the deployment will take place within roughly the next two weeks. Binance first unveiled opBNB alongside launching its testnet on June 19.


Binance kicked off a promotional campaign dubbed “Odyssey” on Aug. 9, with early adopters receiving opBNB Genesis NFTs and being eligible to win a share of $50,000 in prizes. Binance said opBNB Genesis NFTs will confer “a set of benefits and utility for its holders.”

Users must complete a series of tasks to qualify for the NFT, including bridging assets between the opBNB and BNB Chain testnets and minting their own NFT using opBNBScan. opBNB is built on Optimism’s OP Stack, a tech stack for launching customized Layer 2s.

BNB Chain Looks To Reverse Decline
The launch of opBNB follows a long–term downtrend for the total value locked (TVL) and market share of BNB Chain.

Binance To Launch opBNB Layer 2 Network Later This Month
Binance launched its first smart contract network, Binance Chain, in April 2019. The network suffered from poor adoption and technical shortcomings, prompting the launch of BNB Chain (then called Binance Smart Chain) in September 2020 amid DeFi Summer.

BNB Chain offered compatibility with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), meaning developers could migrate code from Ethereum to BNB Chain without making wholesale changes. With the early DeFi boom pushing up transaction fees on Ethereum, BNB Chain positioned itself as a low-cost alternative populated by forks of Ethereum’s leading protocols.

BNB Chain started 2021 with a TVL of $152M before rocketing to an all-time high of $22B in early May, and then oscillating between $9B and $16B for the rest of the year, according to DeFi Llama. BNB Chain consistently ranked as the second-largest smart contract network until getting overtaken by Terra in December 2021.

While Terra abruptly imploded in May 2022, BNB Chain also lost two-thirds of its TVL last year. The downtrend has continued into 2023, with the network getting overtaken by Tron in Q1 and falling to a $3.1B TVL.

Arbitrum, Ethereum’s largest Layer 2, also overtook BNB Chain in March after airdropping its ARB token to early adopters. According to L2beat, the airdrop pushed Arbitrum’s TVL from $3.8B to $5.8B in a single day. Arbitrum currently hosts $5.9B worth of assets, down from a record high of $7B in April.

Ethereum L2s Overshadow Alt L1s
BNB Chain and other cheap Layer 1 networks also face stiff competition in the form of Ethereum’s surging Layer 2 ecosystem.

L2s undermine the value proposition of alternative Layer 1s by offering comparable fee savings with the added benefit of inheriting security guarantees from Ethereum’s $43B Proof of Stake consensus mechanism.

However, some in the crypto community have raised concerns about the lack of working fraud proofs posing a risk to early L2 participants.

China is Binance's largest market, with almost 1m active users, despite cryptos being illegal.

Binance found itself all but shut out of the US after the Securities and Exchange Commission filed a lawsuit against the cryptocurrency exchange in June.


Regulatory pressure became so intense that the embattled firm even considered shutting down its American operations entirely, The Information reported.

However, Binance's prospects appear rosier in China – even though cryptocurrencies are illegal there.

The People's Bank of China banned crypto trading in September 2021 due to their potential to facilitate money laundering and destabilize the country's financial system.

Yet this doesn't appear to have deterred traders from using Binance through VPNs and foreign residency cards, The Wall Street Journal reported.

According to documents obtained by the Journal, Chinese users traded crypto assets worth $90 billion in May this year, making it Binance's largest market by far.

The exchange has 5.6 million accounts in China, with almost one million of those active, according to the internal report titled Mission Control.

""The greatest challenge that Binance faces today is that we (and every other offshore exchange) have been designated a criminal entity in China. At the same time, our opposition in the West bends over backward to paint us as a 'Chinese company,'"" Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao wrote in a blog post last year.

The SEC accused Binance of violating securities laws and operating an illegal exchange in what the SEC chair, Gary Gensler, called a ""web of deception"". Just 24 hours after the lawsuit was filed, customers pulled almost $800 million from the exchange. 

The customer flight is partly why Binance laid off more than 1,000 of its 8,000 employees worldwide last month, the Journal reported.

Some $484 million worth of the tokens were effectively taken out of circulation. Token burn refers to the process of permanent deletion of coins from their circulating supply.

The burn was executed at 10:33 UTC in transaction DE23DB2FB61495A902A22E5DE72744AD587A78881FFC4E3136D2BD2C7E824E29.

BNB uses an auto-burn system that aims to reduce its total supply to 100 million BNB, from the original 200 million BNB, over time. The auto-burn mechanism adjusts the amount of BNB to be burned based on BNB's price and the number of blocks generated on the BNB Smart Chain (BSC) during the quarter.

Ripple Lab's partial victory in a long, drawn-out legal battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) over the sale of XRP has powered the cryptocurrency's surge.

On Thursday, the District Court for the Southern District of New York said Ripple's offer and sale of XRP on digital asset exchanges did not amount to offers and sales of investment contracts as alleged by the SEC.

The Court, however, said that Ripple's direct sale of XRP worth over $700 million to institutions, hedge funds and other parties violated securities laws. The SEC, in late 2020, filed a lawsuit against Ripple for selling unregistered securities after the company sold $1.3 billion worth of XRP. The regulatory action kept saw several exchanges delist XRP and kept the cryptocurrency under pressure while the broader market ended that year on a high note.

The first part of the ruling has opened doors for a renewed listing of XRP by centralized exchanges. Crypto.com has already taken the step and Gemini is exploring the listing of XRP for both spot and derivatives trading.

Meanwhile, the second part of the ruling has determined that XRP is a security, according to CoinShares’ Head of Product, Townsend Lansing.

""The Court has found Ripple to be in violation of securities laws, specifically in relation to direct sales to institutional investors. As such, XRP is not only deemed a security, but questions have arisen regarding the legality of its offering. In regards to these sales, the Court has confirmed that the law was indeed violated, marking a considerable victory for the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and setting a precedent for its legal actions against other cryptocurrencies,"" Langsing said in an email.

""It is important to note that institutional investors who purchased directly from Ripple may find themselves subject to class-action litigation as potential underwriters. This is an area to watch closely, especially if big-name venture capitalists were involved,"" Langsing added.

That way, they would be out of the control of Binance’s founder, Changpeng Zhao.

The SEC claimed in a lawsuit filed last week that Binance and Zhao illegally commingled customer assets, misled customers about the company’s ability to detect market manipulation, allowed US customers to trade on foreign crypto exchanges, and failed to register as a broker, clearing house, exchange, or seller of securities.

Days following its complaint, the SEC sought an emergency order to freeze the company’s assets, saying that it was necessary to protect funds belonging to US customers and under the entities’ control.

Binance argued in separate court documents that an asset freeze would effectively shutter its US businesses and inflict “far reaching impacts” on the public and crypto market participants beyond BAM.

The company said its international exchange, Binance.com, provides services for millions of users in more than 100 countries, many of whom access its alternate banking services because they are unbanked, underbanked, or residing in countries with unstable currencies.

In its request for an emergency order, the SEC said it wanted to ensure the safety of US customer assets and prevent the dissipation of those assets in case any judgment is entered against it.

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/u-judge-rebuffs-sec-request-213146256.html,U.S. Judge Rebuffs SEC Request for Binance.US Asset Freeze for Now,"WASHINGTON, D.C. — The federal judge overseeing the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's case against Binance and Binance.US declined to order a temporary restraining order freezing the U.S. trading platform's assets.

That would allow the U.S. arm of the company to continue doing business while hashing out restrictions with the regulator.


If the two sides can agree on limits, Judge Amy Berman Jackson, of the D.C. District Court, said “there’s absolutely no need” for a restraining order. In the meantime, the judge ordered Binance.US to provide a list of its business expenses to the court, and ordered the parties to continue negotiating. A status update is due by close of business Thursday.

In a packed Washington courtroom, the judge hammered SEC attorneys about their motion to freeze all of the company's assets until it could prove that no one from Binance's global platform, including Changpeng ""CZ"" Zhao, had access to its private keys.

At times, the judge seemed frustrated by the responses she was hearing when asking whether any Binance.US customer funds had actually left the U.S., after multiple SEC attorneys said they were mainly concerned about the fact that Binance's global platform controlled enough private key shards to move funds.

""I want to know if it's happening or not,"" she said. ""It's stunning that I've asked each of you this.""

Sticking point
Earlier in the day, the judge hinted she may have been inclined to grant some sort of restriction on Binance's access to Binance.US assets but not a full restraining order, ordering the companies to reconcile their proposed restrictions and ordering the SEC to contrast what it wanted with what the companies proposed in lieu of the restraining order itself.

Jennifer Farer, an SEC lawyer, told the judge Tuesday, “We are open to the business continuing to operate.”

And representatives of Binance.US said they mainly wanted to be allowed normal operating expenses and that they were “not willing to accept the death penalty” represented by a total asset freeze.

Farer said Binance.US had constantly changed its story about how crypto assets and funds were held, from Binance.US telling the SEC that it had an agreement with Binance to saying the agreement was not operational to saying the non-operational agreement had been suspended.

Binance.US also told the SEC that it may cease doing business in the U.S., prompting the need for an emergency order, the attorney said.

“There’s a back-and-forth about whether they’re shutting down or not shutting down,” Farer said.

Still, at the end of the day the parties were not that far apart, Judge Jackson said. If they could find an agreement, that would give all parties time to properly sort through the case's details.

The SEC sued Binance and Binance.US, alongside Binance founder Changpeng ""CZ"" Zhao, last week, alleging they were operating as an unregistered securities exchange, brokerage and clearing agency.

The regulator also alleged massive commingling of funds allowing Zhao, a Canadian national living in the UAE, access to Binance.US customer assets.

The SEC followed the lawsuit up with a motion for the temporary restraining order.

The crypto exchanges pushed back against the claims in their response to the motion, arguing the SEC hadn't conclusively proven they listed any securities and saying the regulator hadn't shown any proof supporting an emergency motion.

Securities vs. commodities
Judge Jackson also dove into the foundational question at the heart of the suit: What makes a crypto asset a security, and is it a commodity if it isn't a security?

Though the judge asked some elementary questions about the issue, she was not satisfied with the answers.

Near the opening of the hearing, the judge asked SEC attorneys to distinguish between a ""crypto asset"" and a ""crypto asset security.""

SEC attorney Matthew Scarlato told the judge that the regulator had provided several examples of cryptos it believed were securities in the broader complaint, but was also reserving the right to assess the rest of the tokens on the exchanges later.

The judge asked the SEC (and later Binance) whether the other cryptocurrencies were commodities.

""The ones they you're not calling securities, what are they?"" she asked, diving into the heart of an issue that's vexed the crypto industry for years.

She later asked Matthew Martens, an attorney representing Binance.US, if BNB is a commodity since the company had argued it was a security.

""It is a crypto asset,"" Martens said.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

AKIKO FUJITA: Crypto exchange Binance has indefinitely paused all American deposits and given customers until Tuesday to withdraw any dollars. That comes on the heels of the SEC's lawsuit against the company and its founder. Yahoo Finance's David Hollerith has been following the story for us. David, I'm looking at some of the price action today in largest crypto assets. Not a whole lot of swings here, but it's got to make a lot of users a little nervous right now.

DAVID HOLLERITH: Right, yeah, Akiko, this move by Binance US, one way to interpret it is it's a signal that its banking partners have dropped the company. The company said they're moving to be a crypto-only exchange. In the latest in the case the SEC is undergoing with them, has a hearing set for Monday afternoon. And in it, a judge is going to weigh whether or not to take the SEC's motion to place a restraining order on Binance US's assets. And as part of that, it also means preserving the documents, their internal documents that are part of Binance and Binance US.

So we'll wait to see that, but that's obviously a bit of a bigger deal. And when you see these banking partners cut off a company like that, it obviously severely limits liquidity. For Coinbase, it's nothing quite as pressing in the case right now. It's a little bit slower moving just in terms of the first week. CEO Armstrong did say on Wednesday that it's business as usual, but it's still worth pointing out that Moody's changed their outlook for Coinbase yesterday afternoon. And they were citing essentially uncertainty. And for the two companies, crypto's two largest companies, uncertainty is like the main thing that everyone is concerned about.

The Binance case has a little bit-- has several more issues. But I think, in general, it just kind of hangs a worse backdrop in terms of what it means for US investors in the space. But that being said, people have pointed out that Coinbase is in a scenario where they could present arguments that they have a potential chance. With Binance, it looks a little bit more dicey. All this to say, though, that we have been paying attention to the net flows or net transfers going in and out of both companies, or both exchanges. And those have slowed. They've tapered off in the last 24 hours.

And for the last seven days, so what we can assume is like the whole seven-day period since the lawsuits came out, Binance and Coinbase both look fairly sound in terms of what the outflows are. And the reason why we look at this is, obviously, with FTX, after bad news happened in November and people started to question FTX's balance sheet, we started to see sort of a crypto bank crime.

And we've definitely seen higher outflows, $2.4 billion in net flows for Binance and $1.9 billion in net flows, both negative numbers, for Coinbase in the last seven days. So those are still large numbers, but it's nothing like we've seen at FTX. So at least, in the short-term, it seems like investors are not as panicked here. In the long-term, obviously, huge backdrop of uncertainty in terms of what's going to happen with these lawsuits the SEC has filed.

AKIKO FUJITA: Yeah, uncertainty is still the big word within this space. David Hollerith, as always, appreciate that time.",Binance Coin

In a tweet, the U.S. arm of Binance said it's temporarily transitioning to an all-crypto exchange, and the company said trading, staking, deposits and withdrawals in crypto remain fully operational.

USD deposits will be suspended as of June 9, and USD-based trading pairs will be de-listed shortly after, the exchange said.

“While we remain open to a productive compromise that enables a thriving digital asset marketplace in America, Binance.US will continue to vigorously defend ourselves, our customers and the industry against the meritless attacks of the SEC,” the exchange tweeted.

Binance's BNB coin remains stable at $260.24. The token, which was accused of being a security by the SEC, is down 15% over the last week.

As of 2130 ET, Bitcoin is trading roughly 2.5% higher on Binance.US versus its international counterpart. The premium rose as high as 7% earlier in the day when news of the asset freeze first broke.

""It may be that users think they won't be able to get their dollars, or other more speculative cryptocurrencies, out of Binance US, so they are converting to Bitcoin and other assets they would rather hold,” Steven Lubka, managing director at Swan Bitcoin, a trading firm, told The Defiant.


Users may also be anticipating a trading shutdown, according to Lubka. “Arbitrage traders may also be unwilling to deposit funds to take advantage of the spread,"" he said.

“It's estimated that Binance and Binance US have experienced over $1.2bn in net withdrawals since the lawsuit announcement,” said Nauman Sheikh, managing director of Wave Digital Assets, an SEC-registered advisory firm.

“Consequently, BTC and ETH are trading at a significant premium. Normally, this premium would be arbitraged away as traders deposit BTC and ETH on Binance.US to capitalize on the higher price. However, due to current exchange risks, the premium persists,” Sheikh told The Defiant.

‘No Need To FUD’

In addition, effective June 8 at 9am PDT, Binance.US will delist a number of USDT, BTC, and BUSD trading pairs.

Long Term Implications
In the long run, a regulatory crackdown on Binance may mean “a slowdown in VC funding for crypto companies, and the offshoring of the crypto industry,” said Lubka.

The legal proceedings to follow may go swiftly for Binance if the company did “outright illegal things with customer funds,” according to Lubka, who added that a lawsuit against Coinbase may be dragged out in court.

With the loss of trading pairs on Binance.US, users may pivot towards DeFi platforms, according to Sheikh.

“Decentralized exchanges (DEXs) offer a wider selection of pairs compared to the alternative US-based centralized exchanges,” said Sheikh, adding that “US investors, particularly retail, will not have access to foreign exchanges, so their options are limited.”

Delta Blockchain Fund General Partner Kavita Gupta joins Yahoo Finance Live to discuss the outlook for proper crypto regulation and the ongoing debate's impact on crypto markets.

Video Transcript
AKIKO FUJITA: Well, Coinbase and Binance may be the latest targets of Securities and Exchange Commission Commission Chair Gary Gensler, but the regulatory backdrop for the crypto industry remains murky. So the lawsuits this week raise questions whether we could see regulation start to take shape sooner rather than later.

Let's bring in Kavita Gupta, Delta Blockchain fund general partner. Kavita, it's good to talk to you today. As we noted earlier, 14th case that the SEC has brought against crypto entities since January. You've highlighted the fact that this development today is not necessarily a surprise, but it is surprising that they've suddenly identified a group of tokens as securities. I mean, what did that tell you about what the approach is going to be moving forward?

KAVITA GUPTA: Honestly, it actually raises question on the approach, right? Because suddenly you have some 13 tokens and one complaint and 12 tokens and one complaint without any explanation by only these 12 or 13 [INAUDIBLE] security. But are they based on decentralization? Are they based on the usage case of it or lack of centralized-- decentralization? I think the first question that I was reading the complaint yesterday and today, it's like, why these?

And of course, everybody talked about Ethereum was the one which everybody was expecting on this. It wasn't there. But I think the questions out there is, what are the basis of picking up these tokens? What are the basis, which is going to justify going forward? What are actually securities and not securities? And do SEC actually creates a pathway and say, this is how it should work? Or they just say going back, hey, we didn't give you any clarity, but let us sue you. So it's been very interesting conversations around that.

SEANA SMITH: Kavita, do you think that this is actually going to drive Congress to eventually take action? TD Cowan was out with a note today saying that this action from the SEC, it's going to drive a review of the SEC stance. And we could essentially, then, maybe see something finally happen down in DC. Do you agree with that?

KAVITA GUPTA: I think everybody is eyeing the election year. And I do feel like it has become a very politicized topic between Democrats and Republicans because the approaches are very different. Sometime back, Hester Peirce had a document saying that we should have a pathway of what does take a particular token towards saying it's a utility based on how much decentralization over one year or two years has to happen. And we need to give them a pathway to grow.

And that suddenly reappears after a long time in the Republican proposed legislation, which is way more pro crypto than Democrats. Going back to Seana, exactly what you asked, I feel like it's just getting a lot of headlines, but where does it really go from there? Because from last two years, we just keep on hearing headlines after headlines from SEC.

And after the headlines, nothing really moves in any direction. Even the lawsuit, which Coinbase did on SEC, apart from the headline, there has not been any progress. If [INAUDIBLE] fall down, not any progress. So even if you're talking about DC and the government moving in this direction to make a very decisive movement, how much time do we have for them to really do it?

AKIKO FUJITA: Kavita, the lawsuits that we got this week against Coinbase, but as well as Binance, does that complicate the path for Congress in trying to create this regulation? Because the debate, for a long time has, been who actually has the authority to regulate. The SEC, in pushing forward with these losses, they're saying, here's the guardrails that we're sending forward.

KAVITA GUPTA: Yeah, absolutely on point, Akiko. Like, there has been a lot of questions about, who has the authority? Is it just SEC comes and say this is security, so now we're going to go on it? It's just like a big field. And CFTC can come and say, oh, we are not sure about it, maybe because of strong leadership or not. And then SEC can come, having a strong leadership or very vocal leadership to be at that, and say, OK, this is just our jurisdiction. And where does the utility go?

I think there has been a lot of confusion between whether it's commodity versus security, if it's security, how should it go? I think what we're going to see are just a lot of questions, again, back in the market, but what I've learned in last two years, never answer either from the government or from SEC. Hopefully, that changes this time.

SEANA SMITH: Kavita, what do you think this is going to do to startups, just in terms of crypto innovation here in the US? Are we going to see more of those smaller companies look elsewhere to build their business?

KAVITA GUPTA: Unfortunately, last year and a half, already most of the amazing startups have been incorporating outside US, even if they are US citizens. And we have been seeing the innovation, and I'm not even talking about tokens or crypto, but really good blockchain innovation being pushed out to places like Lisbon and Dubai and Singapore. And this is just going to make it even much more stronger. So that's an unfortunate fact about this all hype and no substance or no clarity on, ""Hey, this is the law. Abide by it, and we are all good."" Like, there is nothing like that.

AKIKO FUJITA: I mean, what does that ultimately mean for those investors, those who are holding some of these coins? Because if there's anything we've learned from what happened, for example, with FTX, it was that the fact that so many of these exchanges were operating internationally where the regulatory guidelines were not there, that's what put those users at risk.

KAVITA GUPTA: So I think there are two points, which I would love to cover on this. It's a very good question. The first part is that if you-- Coinbase did go to IPO in the US and disclosed everything. Most of the tokens, which has been listed at security by SEC today, were already listed on Coinbase when they went to IPO. So what really happened, didn't SEC really signed off at that point of time? So how suddenly you are actually-- your job is to protect retail customers. And so you have allowed this to have an offering within US, in fact, have an IPO, and now you're going back and suing and saying, no, you couldn't offer it?

So I'm very confused. I'm not a lawyer, but I'm very confused on this. On the investor side, if I say, there was a big crash when FTX happened or Luna happened or 3AC happened. If you see with these lawsuits the last two days, the maximum down part, which happened in all coins yesterday, over 10%, in fact, Bitcoin, and it went up 2% something today. So the strength hasn't gone in the market. Nobody who are deep crypto natives or investors are actually taking it seriously because most of the traditional investors knows these are just like news headlines.

What really is going to happen here, that pathway is going to take four to five years. Are you just going to make crypto disappear for four to five years till everybody is figuring it out? That's almost impossible to have, right?

SEANA SMITH: Kavita, is that why we're not seeing more of a reaction in Bitcoin today? I mean, take a look at the price of Bitcoin, up just about 4%. Yet, you're seeing more of a crackdown here on these exchanges.

KAVITA GUPTA: So Coinbase, the Coinbase token, like, the security did go down in a significant way because, of course, that's like the one bad news. But I also feel if they're going to report a really good earnings report, like in the past, they actually still going to do really good. Because at the end of the day, what we have seen in last two years, no action and just talk and headlines. So until and unless there is actually going to be a real action and a pathway to figure out something, whether it's an extreme ban or whether it is, let's figure it out, it's a long process.

People who already hold the bag, are they not going to hold it and suddenly going to crash it? There is no reason to do that because the Bitcoin, ETH, and the other altcoin, the businesses built on Polygon, businesses built on Ethereum are still flourishing. There is daily new announcement being products coming out on Bitcoin-based, like a recent Sam Altman product which came out raising $90 million. So I feel like the technology utility is so high that developer adoption is so high, that right now, we're just talking about regulations, which are going to take a decade, and just going to walk around it.

AKIKO FUJITA: Yeah, it feels like that conversation has continued. Kavita Gupta, Delta Blockchain Fund general partner, it's good to have you on today. Really appreciate the time.

Yahoo Finance legal reporter Alexis Keenan explains the SEC's suit and markets reporter Jared Blikre breaks down the market reaction.

Video Transcript
AKIKO FUJITA: Yeah. Let's get to our top story of the day, though. The Securities and Exchange Commission ramping up its crackdown on crypto, just one day after filing a lawsuit against Binance. The SEC is now targeting Coinbase.

We've got team coverage on this. Alexis Keenan is with the details on the charges and Jared Blikre is keeping track of the market reaction. Alexis, we want to start with you. Lay out the SEC's case against Coinbase for us.

ALEXIS KEENAN: Sure, Akiko. So let's just first say these two suits, they target these major crypto platforms that have been in this long dispute with the SEC over its regulatory authority, over both the exchanges as well as cryptocurrencies in general. Now the SEC says that both companies are violating US securities' laws by failing to register with the agency. As for Coinbase, the agency says that the company is also illegally merging market functions that are normally kept distinct from each other.

They say it's acting as a broker, an exchange, a clearing agency, and also a seller of securities. They say, as a result, Coinbase is then evading disclosure laws that were specifically set up to protect consumers by Congress. Now as for the case against Binance, it's similar, but it's a 14-count complaint compared to the SEC's five-count complaint against Coinbase.

In the Binance case, the SEC names both the company and the CEO Changpeng Zhao. It's a 14-count complaint, saying that the company illegally co-mingled customer assets also and misled customers as to the company's ability to detect market manipulation. They also said that the company was allowing US customers to trade on exchanges that were off-limits to US traders.

As for Coinbase, it's already been talking a lot about this case. Its CEO, Brian Armstrong, said the suit might help get some clarity around crypto rules. In an email separately to Yahoo Finance, its general counsel accused the SEC of relying on an enforcement-only technique, saying, (READING) ""The solution is legislation that allows fair rules of the road to be developed transparently and applied equally,"" and ""not litigation.""

They don't like this route, but Brian Armstrong there seeming to say that perhaps, if it's got to be litigation, that maybe there's some rules that will come out of it or some distinctions that these companies can follow. But, look, guys, this is the 14th case that the SEC has brought against crypto entities since January. So they are definitely on the offensive here.

SEANA SMITH: They certainly are on the offensive right now. All right, Alexis, thanks so much. Let's take a look at how we are seeing the response play out in the market because Coinbase under a bit of pressure here, Jared. But when you take a look at Bitcoin, it's actually holding up pretty well.

JARED BLIKRE: Well, yes, up, up, and away here. Let me just show you what's happening today. This is over the rolling 24-hour period, up 4 and 1/2%.

It looks like 25,000, which is actually a little bit below here, was a floor. That's a big historical area for Bitcoin, but we can see it has not yet reclaimed yesterday's high. And so this is factoring also the news we got yesterday from Binance.

Now, overall, these are two of the biggest players in crypto. So you might be asking why did not Bitcoin suffer a little bit more because that would be the natural inclination. But I just want to show you a three-year timeline of Bitcoin and the various prices. I've got some SEC news in here, some Coinbase news. I'm just going to go over a couple.

But, first, Ripple was in the SEC spotlight in December of 2020, so this goes back a long time. Here's where Coinbase listed on the NASDAQ in early 2022. And then here is actually where they got their first little hiccup. (READING) ""Coinbase drops plan to launch crypto lending program.""

Well, they were in discussions with the SEC for a long time. They wanted to offer interest to their customers on their accounts the way, well, you could do that around the world but not necessarily in the US. They dropped that program. But what was later revealed was that Coinbase actually got a subpoena or multiple subpoenas for their efforts.

You go to the SEC palms up, and you're asking for help, guess what. You get a subpoena in return. This is not new enforcement procedures or new procedures for the SEC. This came out about a year later. And of course, by that time, we'd already seen the downfall of crypto.

FTX was in the crosshairs. Lots of things were happening, but I want to point to something else. Coinbase got a Wells Notice, and that was in March of 2022 actually, and so that was actually the first signal. That should be 2023, by the way.

That was the first signal that there was going to be some kind of probe by the SEC on the other side. So this is just kind of confirmation what a lot of investors were already thinking. But my bottom line here is if the SEC doesn't completely shut down Binance and Coinbase, probably not going to derail crypto. But if, in fact, the Coinbase business model cannot survive with SEC regulation, and that would probably take a long time to play out, well, that's a different story altogether.

AKIKO FUJITA: Yeah, as Alexis said, no question that the SEC is on the offensive right now. Jared Blikre, thanks so much.",Binance Coin
https://finance.yahoo.com/news/binance-sees-780-million-outflows-162802316.html,Binance sees $780 million of outflows since being sued by the SEC for breaking securities rules and running a 'web of deception',"Binance customers pulled $790 million from the exchange in the 24 hours after it was sued by the SEC.

The regulator said that the exchange was operating illegally and has violated securities rules.

Binance disputed the claims. The SEC sued Coinbase a day later for also violating regulations.

Customers pulled close to $1 billion from Binance in the 24 hours after it was sued by the US Securities and Exchange Commission for violating securities rules and operating an illegal exchange.


The regulator's complaint says the world's biggest crypto exchange was involved in a ""web of deception"" meant to flaunt securities rules.

Binance has seen $780 in net outflows in ethereum since being sued by the SEC, blockchain analytics firm Nansen tweeted on Tuesday. Investors have deposited $871.7 worth of ethereum in the past 24 hours, though there were $1.65 billion in total outflows, Nansen said.

That comes after regulators filed 13 charges against Binance and its CEO Changpeng Zhao on Monday. Among other violations, regulators have accused the firm of misrepresenting trading controls on Binance.US, as well as secretly allowing ""high-value"" US clients to trade on Binance.com, though American customers are supposed to restricted from its main investment platform.

""Through 13 charges, we allege that Zhao and Binance entities engaged in an extensive web of deception, conflicts of interest, lack of disclosure, and calculated evasion of the law,"" SEC chief Gary Gensler said in a statement. ""They attempted to evade U.S. securities laws by announcing sham controls that they disregarded behind the scenes so that they could keep high-value U.S. customers on their platforms. The public should beware of investing any of their hard-earned assets with or on these unlawful platforms.""

Binance and Binance.US disputed the claims in a blog post and in a post on Twitter.

The exchange has been scrutinized for its compliance with US laws for months. In February, the Wall Street Journal reported that the SEC was investigating the relationship between Binance.US and Sigma Chain and Merit Peak, two trading firms that are affiliated with Zhao. Part of the SEC's complaint says that Sigma Chain was a wash trading operation controlled by Zhao and meant to inflate Binance's trading volumes.

Despite the seemingly staggering net outflow, that shows no signs of slowing down, Nansen data also shows that Binance’s stablecoin balance remains healthy. The exchange currently has a stablecoin balance of just over $8 billion, with a seven-day outflow of $519 million, or roughly 6% of holdings. OKX, the exchange with the next largest holdings, has a balance of $4 billion.

In a Twitter thread, Seoul-based crypto analytics firm CryptoQuant pointed out that the withdrawals are well within historical norms.

The SEC complaint is a doozy.

Binance's CCO is quoted as saying: 'We are operating as a fking unlicensed securities exchange in the USA bro.'

The crypto crackdown has come for Binance.

The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Monday filed a complaint against the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange. The summary opens:


This case arises from Defendants' blatant disregard of the federal securities laws and the investor and market protections these laws provide. In so doing, Defendants have enriched themselves by billions of U.S. dollars while placing investors' assets at significant risk.

The complaint goes from there, rolling through more than 100-pages full of detail. Binance said early Monday in a blog post that it was disappointed by the lawsuit.

There's lots to pour over in the complaint (I'm hoping Bloomberg columnist Matt Levine is going to write about this one), but I'm just going to point you to this incredible exchange from page 29 of the complaint.

Zhao and Binance understood that they were operating the Binance.com Platform in violation of numerous U.S. laws, including the federal securities laws, and that these ongoing violations presented existential risks to their business. 

As Binance's CCO bluntly admitted to another Binance compliance officer in December 2018, ""we are operating as a fking unlicensed securities exchange in the USA bro."" (Emphasis added.)

Coinbase stock fell 10% on Monday after the US Securities and Exchange Commission sued rival crypto exchange Binance and its founder Changpeng Zhao.

The SEC accused Binance of breaking the law by offering unregistered securities to the general public, including its BNB token and BUSD stable coin. The lawsuit also alleged that a staking service offered by Binance also violated securities laws.

Other charges levied against Binance by the SEC included the company's failure to register as a broker as well as its failure to register as an exchange. Finally, the SEC alleged that Binance comingled customer funds, which is what ultimately led to the downfall of Sam Bankman Fried's FTX crypto trading platform last year.

The SEC lawsuit sent shockwaves through the crypto sector, sending shares of Coinbase lower as well as popular crypto coins like bitcoin and ether, which both fell as much as 5%.

For Coinbase, the lawsuit against Binance hits close to home because the popular US crypto exchange is currently being investigated by the SEC and received a Wells notice from the agency earlier this year, which typically serves as a warning that they could ultimately be charged for violating securities laws.

The SEC's main point to crypto firms is that you can't skirt securities laws by offering cryptocurrencies to the public without registering them. The debate is whether cryptocurrencies are in fact securities, which the SEC has argued yes, they are, while crypto firms like Coinbase have argued the opposite.

Coinbase offers its own stablecoin that is listed on its exchange and was not registered with the SEC, and the company also offers its own staking platform, two things the SEC just sued Binance for offering.

While Coinbase has yet to be sued by the SEC, price action in Coinbase's stock following the Binance lawsuit suggest investors are worried about possible enforcement action following the regulator's move against Binance.

The WSJ reported the lawsuit accuses the world's biggest crypto exchange of operating an illegal exchange.

Binance and its US arm, Binance.US, posted reponses strongly disputing the SEC's claims.

The US Securities and Exchange Commission on Monday sued Binance and its CEO, Changpeng Zhao.


The Wall Street Journal reported that the lawsuit accuses the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange of breaking US securities rules and for operating an illegal exchange.

The SEC alleged that Binance diverted customers' funds to a trading firm called Sigma Chain that was under Zhao's control. The regulator also said Sigma Chain conducted fraudulent trades to artificially inflate Binance's volume.

The Journal added that the lawsuit has been filed in federal court in the District of Columbia.

In a blog post, Binance said it was disappointed by the lawsuit, adding that it had recently been in ""good-faith discussions"" to reach a settlement that would've resolved the SEC's probe.

""While we take the SEC's allegations seriously, they should not be the subject of an SEC enforcement action, let alone on an emergency basis,"" Binance said. ""We intend to defend our platform vigorously.  Unfortunately, the SEC's refusal to productively engage with us is just another example of the Commission's misguided and conscious refusal to provide much-needed clarity and guidance to the digital asset industry.""

Binance.US also responded, disputing the SEC's claims in a Twitter post.

""For nearly two and a half years, Binance.US has engaged in good faith with the SEC. All along, the objective of our engagement has been consistent: work constructively toward a clear, practical regulatory framework that enables businesses like ours to grow, create jobs, and provide American consumers safe access to digital assets,"" the post reads.

""Simply put, today's filing is unjustified by the facts, by the law, or by the Commission's own precedent.""

Binance also denied any allegations that user assets on Binance.US were at risk and said all user assets on Binance and affiliates, including Binance.US, are safe and secure.

In February, the Journal reported the SEC was looking into the relationship between the US arm of Binance and two trading firms with ties to Zhao.

Sigma Chain and Merit Peak acted as market makers that trade cryptocurrencies on the Binance.US exchange. One area of the investigation's focus was how Binance.US disclosed to customers its links to the trading firms, the report said.

The agency requested information about Sigma Chain and Merit Peak from Binance.US, which is the subject of an existing enforcement investigation, sources told the Journal.

The SEC lawsuit is the latest legal headache for Binance. In March, the Commodities Futures and Trading Commission sued the company, alleging among other things that staff knew compliance efforts were just ""for show"" and that it was possibly facilitating transactions by Palestinian militants and Russian criminals.

Binance has denied the CFTC's allegations.

Meanwhile, the Justice Department also is investigating Binance. Federal prosecutors have looked into US hedge funds' dealings with the cryptocurrency exchange, according to a Washington Post report in January.

Several American investment firms have received subpoenas, directing them to send records of communication with Binance to the US attorney's office for the Western District of Washington in Seattle.

Blockchain data shows that the exchange endured some $503 million in net outflows on Monday, according to a Dune Analytics chart by crypto investment product provider 21Shares. Traders have withdrawn more than $1 billion of digital assets during this period, compared to the $546 million in deposits, per the chart.


This is on track to be the largest daily net outflow since at least mid-March, when investors worried about failing crypto-friendly banks destabilizing crypto exchanges, according to data by 21Shares.

Crypto intelligence firm Nansen's data showed that at one point Binance recorded $231 million more withdrawals than deposits within a one-hour period following the news about the lawsuit. The data excludes bitcoin (BTC) transfers.

Binance's crypto wallets hold some $55 billion of digital assets, according to Nansen data on exchange reserves.

The outflows came as the SEC lawsuit alleges that Binance, the world’s largest crypto exchange by trading volume, breached multiple federal securities laws. The suit said that Binance offered unregistered crypto securities, including BNB and BUSD tokens, to the general public and allowed for commingling of customer funds.

The SEC also alleges that CZ, the company’s chief executive officer, was “secretly” in control of Binance.US, an ostensibly separate entity operating in the U.S., and a CZ-owned entity had inflated Binance.US’s trading volume.",Binance Coin

The suit also alleged multiple times that Binance allowed U.S. persons (meaning U.S. citizens or people living in the U.S.) to trade on its platform, despite saying it wasn't.

""As a second part of Zhao’s and Binance’s plan to shield themselves from U.S. regulation, they consistently claimed to the public that the Binance.com Platform did not serve U.S. persons, while simultaneously concealing their efforts to ensure that the most valuable U.S. customers continued trading on the platform,"" the suit said. ""When the Binance.US Platform launched in 2019, Binance announced that it was implementing controls to block U.S. customers from the Binance.com Platform. In reality, Binance did the opposite. Zhao directed Binance to assist certain high-value U.S. customers in circumventing those controls and to do so surreptitiously because – as Zhao himself acknowledged – Binance did not want to 'be held accountable' for these actions.""

The SEC also alleged that a number of other tokens, including the native coins for the Solana (SOL), Cardano (ADA), Polygon (MATIC), Coti (COTI) and Algorand blockchains (ALGO), Filecoin network (FIL), Cosmos hub (ATOM), Sandbox platform (SAND), Axie infinity (AXS) and Decentraland (MANA) are securities.

Binance's own Chief Compliance Officer told another employee in 2018 that ""we are operating as a fking unlicensed securities exchange in the USA,"" the suit said.


Commingling and diverting funds
Binance and its poor financial controls meant that customer funds were diverted, including potentially for personal uses, the suit said. Merit Peak Limited, a market maker previously tied to Zhao, had access to ""billions of U.S. dollars of customer funds,"" while Sigma Chain, another CZ-controlled entity, received nearly $200 million from BAM Trading and a BAM Trading custody account, the SEC alleged. CZ himself allegedly ""personally received $62.5 million from one of the Binance bank accounts"" between October 2022 and January 2023.

""Lacking regulatory oversight, Defendants were free to and did transfer investors’ crypto and fiat assets as Defendants pleased, at times commingling and diverting them in ways that properly registered brokers, dealers, exchanges and clearing agencies would not have been able to do,"" the suit said.

Sigma Chain also bought a yacht for $11 million from the account that had access to customer funds, the SEC said.

According to the suit, CZ owned 100% of an entity called ""CPZ Holdings Limited,"" which in turn owned 100% of ""BAM Management Company Limited,"" which for its part owned 81% of ""BAM Management US Holdings Inc.,"" with the remaining equity going to seed investors and former employees. BAM Management US was the parent company to BAM Trading Services, which in turn operates Binance.US.

Binance maintained that the company is still seeking to fill hundreds of open roles at the exchange.

""This will include looking at certain products and business units to ensure our resources are allocated properly to reflect the evolving demands of users and regulators.""

The statement came in response to Insider's query to Binance about independent crypto journalist Colin Wu's tweets that said the company may lay off 20% of its employees in June.

""The compensation plan will be formulated according to different situations in different places,"" his tweet, which cited unnamed sources, said. ""The layoffs may be related to the poor overall market and the large expansion before.""

CEO Changpeng Zhao denied any mass layoffs and said the company has been profitable since the year it was founded.

Instead, the crypto exchange has a ""bottom out program,"" which the exec said routinely weeds out staff that may not be a good fit for the firm.

Here’s all You Need to Know,"Blockchain network BNB Chain is expected to undergo a network upgrade at block height 29,020,050, estimated to arrive on June 11 at 21:30 UTC, developers released on GitHub.

Network improvements typically attract investors and users to blockchain ecosystems as they allow developers to provide even better features. BNB Chain utilizes the bnb token (BNB) for users to pay fees with and vote on network changes – meaning such upgrades could contribute toward the value proposition for bnb in the future.


The Luban hard fork incorporates three different Binance Smart Chain (BSC) Evolution Proposals (BEPs): BEP-126, BEP-174 and BEP-221, which cumulatively aim to make the network faster and more secure for users.

BEP-126 introduces the “Fast Finality” mechanism, which makes it impossible for a block to be reversed once it is finalized on the network. This reduces the possibility of a chain reorganization by bad actors, if that situation ever arises.

Blocks refer to data within the blockchains where transactional data is permanently recorded and secured by cryptography. These are finalized by network entities called validators, and can theoretically be reserved if a majority of those validators collude and decide to revert to a data point in the past.

BEP-174 brings forth a “Cross Chain Relayer Management,” which aims to mitigate any potential security issues in the BSC Bridge. Attacks on bridges were the biggest security threat in the crypto sector in 2022 – making this a critical area to deploy solutions.

Relayers are on-chain messengers who help transfer tokens between different blockchains via bridges, playing an important role in ensuring that such transactions are completed smoothly. These relayers are typically whitelisted entities that currently need to be manually added in a complex process.

However, BEP-174 will introduce “managers” for relayers that are selected by on-chain governance. These managers would be responsible for managing the registration of individual relayers in a way that makes it easy to remove or add any relayer during a potential time of crisis.

Lastly, BEP-221 brings forth the “CometBFT Light Block Validation,” a system that proposes adding a new contract to blockchains that use CometBFT technology.

This contract helps verify specific blocks from other CometBFT-compatible blockchains and enables the transfer of data between those blockchains, such as the storage-focused BNB Greenfield, and the BNB Chain.",Binance Coin

Binance NFT, which already supports NFTs on Ethereum, Polygon and its native BNB Chain, plans to expand its offerings by allowing traders to purchase Ordinals on the Bitcoin network. Collectors can soon buy and sell inscriptions, or NFTs created on the Bitcoin network, expanding the reach of the nascent Ordinals ecosystem.


See Also: Bitcoin NFTs: What Are Ordinal NFTs and How Do You Mint One?

Additionally, in order to help onboard users to Bitcoin NFTs, Binance will allow traders to purchase Bitcoin-based NFTs with their Binance accounts, simplifying the process for users. Instead of having to set up a taproot-compatible Bitcoin wallet to purchase Ordinals, as collectors wanting to mint NFT giant Yuga Labs’ TwelveFold Ordinals needed to do, Binance aims to make the process simple and secure for new buyers to enter the growing market.

Binance Head of Product Mayur Kamat said in a press release that he sees Bitcoin as “the broadest choice” for NFT collectors as well as a growing market for the exchange to tap into.

“Bitcoin is the OG of crypto,” said Kamat. “We believe things are just getting started here and can’t wait to see what the future holds in this space.”

However, Binance’s relationship with Bitcoin hasn’t all been positive in recent days. On Sunday, the exchange paused Bitcoin withdrawals twice, citing network congestion as the catalyst.

As Ordinals reached 3 million inscriptions last week, the demand for marketplaces to embrace Bitcoin NFTs is only intensifying. In March, NFT marketplace Magic Eden added support for Ordinals, integrating Bitcoin wallets Hiro and Xverse to do so. In April, the marketplace rolled out a creator launchpad to help artists mint their inscriptions before listing on the secondary marketplace.",Binance Coin

Video Transcript
- Crypto exchange Binance halted Bitcoin withdrawals earlier today. Let's bring in Yahoo Finance's Rachelle Akuffo, who has the details for us. Rachelle, how do we see some of the moves on the back of that?

RACHELLE AKUFFO: Well, so we're taking a look at some of the takeaways from the selling action that we've been seeing in some of these cryptos, especially Bitcoin. You mentioned Binance, the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange, suspending those withdrawals. And that was due to too many pending transactions, according to CEO CZ. He tweeted that the problem was due to an unexpected surge in Bitcoin transaction fees, which had fluctuated an 18x from last month.

He also added in it was FUD, or fear, uncertainty, and doubt, also fueling this. But that skepticism and speculation about whether it was some of these big crypto whales selling their positions, that spread. So, of course, down went Bitcoin and dragged down other tokens with it on a day that already had a mixed picture in general for investors. Now, CEO CZ also tweeting, we're aware that some data are showing a large volume of outflows from Binance. This outflow is actually movements between Binance hot and cold wallets due to the BTC address adjustments.

Now, if this had been just effective outflows, this would have marked the largest withdrawal in its history at over 162,000 Bitcoin, worth over $4.6 billion. Now, Julio Moreno, who's the head of research at CryptoQuant, he noted that these two transactions in question of 117,000 and 40,000 Bitcoin respectively were between Binance addresses. So putting those effective outflows closer to about 10,100 Bitcoin. So not as big of a deal as originally thought. But still, a lot of skepticism here.

- There's a lot of skepticism there. Rachelle, let's also talk about what we're seeing take place at Coinbase because Coinbase shares were under a little bit of pressure today. The CEO there coming out, doubling down on criticisms of regulatory headwinds, also saying that they're not going to back down. They will gladly go face to face with the SEC. What are we learning there?

RACHELLE AKUFFO: I mean, this is quite the turnaround. We had Coinbase saying they're not leaving the US. CEO Brian Armstrong walking back those earlier comments on the possibility of having Coinbase leave the US because of those regulatory headwinds. He told CNBC this morning, Coinbase is not going to relocate overseas. We're always going to have the US presence. But the US is a little bit behind right now.

In terms of examples you could look to, he praised the more thoughtful approaches, as he called them, in the EU for passing comprehensive crypto legislation, as well as the UK he said being incredibly welcoming as a reason why it's a hub that they've decided to serve as well. But, of course, SEC is still in the headlights there. Armstrong called the SEC an outlier in the way it's approaching crypto to curtail it rather than regulate it. But he says that these lawsuits-- you look for a silver lining here-- they offer a chance for more clarity, which will benefit the industry as a whole. Hopefully, get some answers on some of these different criteria.

- Yeah. Brian Armstrong has had some pretty strong words for the SEC on the back of some concerns around that regulation. All right. What's the latest coming out of DC when it comes to crypto mining?

RACHELLE AKUFFO: Well, it's interesting because we thought we pretty much just had to look at the SEC in this. And we that the Biden administration was looking at not being fond of having people adding crypto to their 401(k). But now on the mining side, the Biden administration added the new Digital Asset Mining Energy. That's DAME. That's the excise tax. Its proposal to its budget last week.

So basically, what will happen is after a phase in period, crypto miners would face a tax equal to 30% of the cost of the electricity they use in crypto mining, essentially, the White House saying pay your fair share. Now, the White House estimates that in 2022, US crypto mining used about the same amount of electricity used to power the entire country's home computers or residential lighting. So to give you some context there. And, of course, the United States by far the biggest crypto mining country in the world. So this will really be a blow for crypto miners.

- It will be something we will continue to track. All right. Rachelle, thanks so much.",Binance Coin

But there are growing concerns about the legal pressure the world's largest crypto exchange, Binance could face. Brady Dale is the Axios Crypto reporter. He joins us now in studio. Good to see you, Sir. I want to get to the potential regulations coming down upon them. But let's start with just how big Binance is compared to the rest of the industry.

BRADY DALE: Sure. I mean, it's the biggest crypto exchange by far, ranked number one by everyone. I just took a glance at CoinGecko, which is one of the data site's numbers on it. And they said that Binance has $68 billion in crypto assets in its reserves. So just $68 billion is the amount people have entrusted to it to hold on to that they trade. It does like, probably got this number wrong, but like, like, $19 billion in trades a day. I mean, it's just-- you know, it's--

- It's a behemoth.

BRADY DALE: Yeah, yeah. And I think over 100 million users, I think, something like that, they've said, yeah.

SEANA SMITH: Well, Brady, I mean, when you take into account the legal pressure that Binance is under right now from the Justice Department, from the SEC, from the CFTC, what does all of this mean given the fact that Binance is such a large player within crypto?

BRADY DALE: Yeah, well, I mean, if something serious happened, it would be huge in the industry. But keep in mind, I mean, this is a global company, right? And the United States is a big important country, but it's just one country. And so they've tried to keep US people off of it. But the US could crack down. But it's going to have to find a way to get a lever onto Binance because it kind of exists everywhere and nowhere.

And also note, like, the things, the Justice Department, that's only been rumors so far. I mean, they haven't actually done anything yet. Everyone expects they will, but everyone's been expecting that they will.

- Do you expect action from the DOJ? There is a lot of whispers.

BRADY DALE: There's so many whispers. I wouldn't be surprised if it happened at some point. But they've also got to figure out a way to get their hands on people there. And I think they're probably ready for that.

- And would this be related to money laundering?

BRADY DALE: My guess-- yeah, if I-- all the criticisms of Binance. And they mostly go back to its early days, right, is that they have done business with people they shouldn't have done business with. So like, whether it's criminals or terrorists or whatever. So yeah, that would be my guess.

My guess is don't look for an FTX-style collapse. I think that would be a mistake to look for that for Binance. But they could get in a lot of trouble. But then that would require to shut them down. You'd have to coordinate a lot of countries to crack down all at once. Like, just the-- just the US wouldn't be enough.

SEANA SMITH: So the ripple effects then from the US. What does that look like? Are we talking about Bitcoin? I seem to be able to shrug off a lot of the concerns back at 30,000. So is this something that you think is going to have a similar effect maybe in terms of what we saw with FTX if we were to see this with Binance?

BRADY DALE: If something dramatic happened with Binance, it would be devastating in the near to medium turn for the crypto markets. And then it would completely recover like nothing ever happened, I mean, ultimately. Like, I mean, that is-- that is what would happen, I think. Like, there, yeah, it would hurt real bad. If you were the kind of investor who was looking for returns the next six to seven months, which a lot of crypto people are, not fun for you. But long-term, it's all going to be fine.

- Wow, interesting. So Gary Gensler, SEC chair, on Twitter put out this video, seemed like it may have been aimed at CZ and Binance. Let's listen to that.

GARY GENSLER: If you make securities available to American investors, you must comply with American laws. The law is clear. If you're a securities exchange, clearinghouse, broker, or dealer, you must come into compliance. Register with us and deal with conflicts of interest and disclose important information.

- Is he talking to my hands there to CZ? And what do you make of the lack of regulation going back years now?

BRADY DALE: I think everybody would love to know who Gary Gensler is talking to in that quote because he never gives a clear answer. Like, I don't know if you saw in Congress a week or so ago. The head of the House Financial Services Committee asked him six times, like, is ETH-- is the second largest cryptocurrency in the entire world, the one that everyone uses, is it a security? And he wouldn't answer the question.

And so it's like, if he won't say what anything is, like, how can anyone know what is actually in their purview? I thought Matt Levine said this really well in his column a while back. He was like, the SEC keeps saying that if you're going to trade security in the United States, you need to register with us. But we're not going to register anything to trade your securities. And we're also going to tell you what securities are.

So like, good luck this industry here. So it's just-- yeah, it is really frustrating, I think, to the industry that they're not being clear. And the real problem is that they're not grappling with is that the instruments in this industry do genuinely work in a different way. So like a most important point, like, let's say ETH was is security, right? Most people agree that ETH is a genuinely decentralized enterprise.

Well, under current securities laws, you need somebody to do quarterly reporting to the SEC. Well, who would do that for Ethereum? Nobody runs it. It's run by the internet. And yet, on the flip side, you could also say like, there's no need for quarterly reporting because all the information is just right out there in open in the open on the Ethereum blockchain.

So like, what do you need to fill out these forms for? So it's just a-- it is a very strange situation that he's putting the crypto industry in. It seems like the Biden administration is just saying the crypto industry, we don't want you here. Just get out. Then people are leaving.

SEANA SMITH: Brady, do you think the crypto industry is going to look materially different within the next year? It sounds like even if we do get a crackdown, it won't really have a massive impact on the sector. Is that fair to say?

BRADY DALE: Well, it will have a massive impact on whoever gets cracked down on. I mean, they're not going to like it. But, you know.

SEANA SMITH: But more broadly speaking--

BRADY DALE: --broader spectrum-- I think lots of changes are going to happen, though, it might not be in a year. Like, a lot of times, these downturns take a little bit longer than that. I mean, what's really going to matter in the future, everyone focuses on regulation. And this is just my view. But I've been around here for a while.

What's really going to matter is the next time somebody invents something that really gets investors excited. Like, that's what's going to actually change the industry. I mean, regulatory clarity would be nice, and it would be good. But that's not what would-- that's not what will drive the next bull market. What will drive the next bull market will be somebody making a thing people are excited to use.

- Just want to circle back quickly to Binance. If there was action, whether that's the DOJ or CFTC, how would that impact Coinbase?

BRADY DALE: Would be great for a Coinbase. I mean, like, it's the-- I mean, as long as-- I mean, keep in mind, the SEC has a wells notice against Coinbase right now. I mean, they've basically said, we're going to bring the hammer down on you too. But if that doesn't happen, yeah, the biggest exchange in the entire world, if it disappears, that will naturally be really good for the biggest exchange in the United States.",Binance Coin
https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bitcoin-cash-spikes-10-halving-115343812.html,"Bitcoin Cash Spikes 10% After Halving, Bitcoin Hovers Above $66K","Bitcoin Cash (BCH) surged 10% after successfully completing its reward halving event that cut the block reward to 3.125 BCH.

The cryptocurrency market remains mostly unchanged, with bitcoin – whose halving occurs later this month – trading at just above $66,300, up 0.3% in the past 24 hours.

Bitcoin Cash (BCH) surged 10% after completing its reward halving event, becoming one of the few gainers in an otherwise tepid market as bitcoin {{BTC}} – whose own halving occurs later this month – remained little changed over 24 hours.


BCH changed hands at $660 in European morning hours, a price level not seen since December 2021. The token remains 80% below a lifetime peak of $3,700 set in December 2017.

Bitcoin Cash’s block reward is now 3.125 BCH. Halving occurs when the reward for mining transactions is cut by 50%, reducing the rate at which new coins are created and thus lowering the available new supply.

Bitcoin’s own halving is expected on April 20, trackers show, and has historically preceded a bull market for the token. The previous halving, in 2020, spurred a 1,000% run to a then-record high of $69,000 roughly a year and a half later.

Open interest on BCH-tracked futures swelled to $700 million earlier this week from below $200 million in March, showing an increase in leveraged bets on more expected price volatility, as previously reported.

Meanwhile, crypto markets remained little changed in the past 24 hours amid the lack of market-moving catalysts. Bitcoin traded at just above $66,300, up 0.3% in the past 24 hours, and the CoinDesk 20, a broad-based liquid index of major tokens, excluding stablecoins, was down 0.7%.

Ether {{ETH}}, BNB Chain’s BNB and Solana’s {{SOL}} were up 1%, while dogecoin {{DOGE}}, Polkadot’s DOT, XRP and Cardano’s ADA were down as much as 1.2%.

Alex Kuptsikevich, a senior market analyst at FxPro, told CoinDesk in an email that the current lull was expected and traders were likely to be waiting for macroeconomic catalysts before making a move.

“While Bitcoin's inability to rise is alarming, we saw a weaker dollar and stronger stock indices the day before, which is fuelling risk appetite,” Kuptsikevich said. “The cryptocurrency market's lagging performance can easily be attributed to accumulated overbought conditions and wariness ahead of the monthly labour market report,'’ which is due tomorrow.

“At the same time, we regard the current weakness as consolidation within the bull market, almost excluding the risks of a long-term reversal,” he said.",Ripple 
https://finance.yahoo.com/news/must-bitcoin-drop-ideals-decentralization-170443905.html,Must Bitcoin ‘Drop Ideals’ of Decentralization to Achieve Mass Adoption?,"Can crypto scale and still retain its commitment to individuals holding their own keys? Increasingly it seems like the answer is “no.” As blockchain security firm CertiK pointed out in a recent report, nearly half of the $503 million lost in crypto security breaches this past quarter involved private key compromises.

This feature is part of CoinDesk’s “Future of Bitcoin” package and excerpted from The Node newsletter, a daily roundup of the most pivotal crypto news on CoinDesk and beyond. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.


To be fair, this statistic is likely skewed by a few high profile instances. Namely, the $112.5 million hack of Ripple co-founder and executive chair Chris Larsen’s personal XRP wallets in January.

There were fewer total key compromises (26 incidents) than rug pulls (34 incidents), though if counting phishing scams (83 incidents) — which is definitely a matter of users maintaining control over their coins — key management incidents account for a hefty majority of losses in Q1 2024.

Of course, this is nothing new: people have been losing access to their “wallet.dat files” since the days of yore when Bitcoiners were able to mine BTC on their desktops. One poor soul has for years been fighting for permission to excavate a landfill in the U.K. after mistakenly tossing out a hard drive with 7,500 bitcoins.

People lose access to their keys in attacks like SIM swaps and social engineering exploits; by forgetting their seed or pass phrases; sometimes hardware simply fails, be it hard drives or cold wallets; or things can be wiped in a natural disaster like a fire or flood, and yes, sometimes boating accidents happen.

The point is, key management is an unsolved problem in crypto. This is why, as crypto has scaled to more and more users, there have been more and more custodial solutions that replace the challenges of proper key management — which is dangerous and difficult — with the familiar security solutions of using passwords to log into third party services.

“There’s an overwhelming demand in the Bitcoin community that we must scale, we must scale, we must scale,” Craig Raw, founder of bitcoin desktop wallet Sparrow, said in a panel discussion at Adopting Bitcoin Arnhem 2024.

A video recording of a four minute clip featuring Raw from the event has recently been making the rounds on Crypto Twitter in part because Raw convincingly lays out the tension between getting blockchains — specifically Bitcoin — into the hands of hundreds of millions of users and the challenges of maintaining decentralization.

“We have given up a lot of things in Bitcoin because of this demand to scale. And I'm just going to throw it out there that I don't necessarily think scaling is the be all and end all of everything that we should be thinking about,” he said.

Notably, the only way for crypto to remain censorship-resistant is for people to maintain their own keys. There is an old idea in the Bitcoin community that “Uncle Jims” could run nodes for smaller groups of less technically-inclined people, an idea that has been increasingly diminished, Raw said.

“It used to be like no debates around the fact that that's not your keys, not your coins. I'm seeing erosion in that term,” Raw said. “If you ask people today, what ‘Uncle Jim’ means, it's the guy who custodies bitcoin on behalf of the family unit. You see the difference between those two things?""

Gleb Zykov, chief technology officer of a HashEx Blockchain Security, noted in his company’s own report of Q1 hacks that “if anything, every incident shows the continuous and sophisticated nature of threats facing this industry,” suggesting the risks of self-custody will only get harder.

I don’t have all the answers here, whether it’s possible to maintain the precepts of decentralization while also encouraging mass adoption. And neither, apparently, does Raw: “If you start to drop your ideals, you start to lose those things that make bitcoin unique.”

It depends then on what you value.",Ripple 
https://finance.yahoo.com/news/garlinghouse-says-sec-press-judge-203216008.html,Garlinghouse Says SEC to Press Judge for $2B in Fines and Penalties in Ripple Case,"The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is apparently asking a New York judge to levy a $2 billion judgment against Ripple Labs, according to social media posts from the crypto company’s CEO and chief legal officer on Monday.

The SEC’s motion for judgment and remedies, filed on Friday, remains under seal to outside parties. According to Stuart Alderoty, Ripple Labs’ chief legal officer, redacted versions of the documents will be publicly available by Tuesday, March 26.


The judgment would bring an end to this phase of the multi-year legal battle between Ripple Labs and the SEC, which began in December 2020 when the SEC filed suit against the crypto firm and its executives, alleging that they violated federal securities laws by selling XRP to both institutional and retail customers.


When it was filed, the action led to the widespread delisting or trading suspension of XRP from U.S. exchanges. A federal judge ruled last year that Ripple violated federal securities laws in directly selling XRP to institutional investors, though not in selling XRP to retail investors through exchanges.

Brad Garlinghouse, Ripple Labs’ CEO, suggested in his X (formerly Twitter) post that the company will fight back against the proposed judgement motion.

""The SEC plans to ask the Judge for $2B in a case that involved no allegations (let alone findings) of fraud or recklessness,"" Garlinghouse wrote. ""There is absolutely no precedent for this. We will continue to expose the SEC for what they are when we respond to this.""

Alderoty wrote that the company will file its response to the SEC’s motion next month, adding ""As we all have seen time and time again, this is a regulator that trades in statements that are false, mischaracterized and designed to mislead … Rather than faithfully apply the law, the SEC remains bent on wanting to punish and intimidate Ripple – and the industry at large. We trust the Court will approach the remedies phase fairly.""",Ripple 
https://finance.yahoo.com/news/happens-sec-classifies-eth-security-193636373.html,What Happens if the SEC Classifies ETH a Security? (Wrong Answers Only),"It came to light yesterday that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is likely looking to reclassify Ethereum’s native token, ether {{ETH}}, as a security. Not everyone believes this to be the case, and so far the SEC has deferred answering definitively on whether there is an ongoing probe of the Ethereum Foundation — just like how the agency has punted the can on saying definitively that ETH is or isn’t a security.

This is an excerpt from The Node newsletter, a daily roundup of the most pivotal crypto news on CoinDesk and beyond. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.

A number of digital asset lawyers have said the “voluntary inquiry” the Ethereum Foundation copped to in its Github repository is no cause for alarm. Subpoenaing crypto companies is a normal course of business in this industry. And the Ethereum Foundation’s canary — a reference to “canaries in coal mines,” which indicates whether a government has probed a website — had to come down eventually.


“It is very difficult to know, from what has been publicly disclosed thus far, the nature of the government inquiry that has been sent to the Ethereum Foundation or whether the Foundation is the target of that investigation,” Preston Byrne, managing partner of Byrne & Storm, P.C., told CoinDesk in an email.

Byrne said that it is “unlikely” that the Ethereum Foundation “is the target of the investigation.” However, taking it as a given that there is an ongoing probe, a few questions remain. For instance, it’s not yet clear why exactly the SEC would sue the creators of Ethereum nearly 10 years after its launch and after hundreds of billions of dollars have accrued to the network.

Does the investigation pertain to Ethereum’s initial coin offering and token distribution or its switch to the staking security model? How is it that a U.S. securities regulator has jurisdiction over an organization based in Zug, Switzerland? Will the Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), which oversees a booming ETH futures market, push back?

As to why crypto companies are being asked about their dealings with the Ethereum Foundation, Byrne offered two plausible causes: either the SEC is trying to classify ETH as a security to force the hand of U.S. spot exchanges to de-list the token or to support its case for denying much-demanded spot ether exchange traded funds (ETFs).

Neither motivation would “necessarily also require the SEC to bring an enforcement action against the foundation,” Byrne added.

But say there is a lawsuit. Say ETH is a security (despite good reasons saying no). What exactly happens then? Ethereum is the second-largest blockchain by value ($414 billion at today’s prices), and the home of most of the digital asset industry’s most used tools — classifying ETH as a security would likely cause chaos. With a move this big, it is entirely unpredictable where the cards will ultimately fall.

The Demerge …
One of the more unlikely responses is that Ethereum, which switched to a proof-of-stake algorithm that rewards tokens to users who lock up their tokens to secure the network, could revert back to the mining model pioneered by Bitcoin. This in itself is unlikely; it took Ethereum developers at and outside of the Ethereum Foundation years to switch to staking.

Vitalik Buterin came up with the idea for Ethereum in 2013, and, even back then, he figured the blockchain would likely need to switch to staking, a “consensus model” that was at the time in its infancy. It was only in 2020, five years after the network actually launched, that the first tangible step towards Ethereum staking was taken with the launch of the Beacon chain.

Ethereum developers deployed and refigured a number of testnets to experiment with switching to staking over several years, and a “de-merge” would likely take as long.

Part of the issue, apart from the scaling and cost benefits of staking is that mining is a purposefully energy-intensive process, and one that developers were happy to say goodbye to. After “the Merge,” it is theorized that Etheruem’s energy consumption declined 99% — shutting down critics of crypto’s environmental footprint.

""It’s impossible for me to see any outcome as you point out that would result in something like a merge,"" Paul Brody, head of blockchain at EY, told CoinDesk.

ETH PoW Powered Up
Ethereum is Ethereum and Ethereum Classic is Ethereum Classic, even if Ethereum Classic {{ETC}} actually maintains the “original, unaltered” history of the blockchain. But what if Ethereum Classic, from which Ethereum was forked, becomes the conical chain? This would certainly be an easier solution than the “Demerge,” considering the network is already running.

Sure, Ethereum Classic has experienced a number of faith-busting re-orgs, but readopting Ethereum’s lovelorn sibling could answer SEC Chairman Gary Gensler’s apparent concerns over staking. So would the alternative to the alternative Ethereum: EthereumPoW (ETHW), the fork that launched during the Merge to retain proof-of-work.

Neither ETC nor ETHW has rallied much on news of the SEC’s potential investigation, indicating their rapid adoption is unlikely. But it’s not impossible. Afterall, Buterin did admit that ETC was “a totally fine chain.”

One notable downside of this, among many, is that Etheruem’s founders would likely maintain massive stakes of ETC or ETHW tokens, mirroring the state of their ETH holdings at the time of the two forks. It’s not clear whether or not the SEC is concerned about Ethereum’s token issuance, which distributed valuable tokens to the founding team and the Ethereum Foundation. But the agency has said in the past such disbursements resemble investment contracts.

XRP wins?
The XRP Army has been waiting for a moment like this for years. Although not as visible a conflict as Ethereum versus Solana or Bitcoin versus Everyone, many XRP stans absolutely despise Ethereum. The history here likely stems from Bill Hinman, the former head of the SEC's division of corporation finance, declaring that ETH was not a security because it was “sufficiently decentralized.” The XRP Army, backing its own project, has seen that intervention as unfairly picking winners in the crypto market, privileging one project for special consideration while downing others that look quite similar.

Over the years, XRP champions, including Ripple Labs CEO Brad Garlinghouse, have argued that Ethereum is “Chinese controlled”; that Vitalik Buterin could be co-opted by the Chinese Communist Party; and that the network itself was “cherry-picked” to win by U.S. authorities. Of course, Buterin didn’t win himself any favors when responding to these accusations by calling XRP a “sh*tcoin.”

See also: Why the XRP Army Keeps Fighting

One thing XRP has going for it is that, unlike most cryptocurrencies, there is actually a little legal clarity surrounding that asset after Ripple Labs fought back in court against the SEC, and won a few concessions from the presiding judge. XRP itself is not a security, and exchange trades with it are not securities transactions, though Ripple’s programmatic sales to qualified buyers were investment contracts, the judge ruled.

""It is the characteristics of the sale or offer for sale that make something an investment contract, not necessarily which cryptocurrency it is. ETH is sold on public exchanges without advertising,"" Christa Laser, a law professor at Cleveland State University, told CoinDesk. ""The SEC is likely targeting only staking rewards, but it will need to show that there is a central promoter.

Gensler’s reputation, tarnished again
In fact, one possible outcome of the SEC going after ETH is another major loss for the agency in court. As former CFTC Commissioner Brian Quintenz said yesterday, the SEC already implicitly said ETH was a commodity after it allowed the launch of ETH futures and ETH futures ETFs in the U.S. Further, countless U.S. investors, businesses and individuals have acted on the SEC’s signals over the years that ETH is not a security.

Add to this that there is a growing acknowledgment that Gensler’s SEC has been unfair in its legal fight with the crypto industry. Instead of devising comprehensive regulations that actually account for the differences between decentralized protocols and traditional ways of doing business, he has launched lawsuit after lawsuit against companies that add — rather than detract value — from the U.S. economy.

This “lawfare” hasn’t always worked out for Gensler. Just recently, a U.S. federal judge called out the SEC’s ""gross abuse of the power” for ""deliberately perpetuating falsehoods"" in its dispute with crypto firm DEBT Box. This is on top of the unprecedented shutdown by a three-judge appeals panel that called out the agency’s yearslong denial of spot bitcoin ETFs “arbitrary and capricious.”

In short: If it’s true the SEC is trying to build a case for denying spot ETH ETFs by going after the underlying asset, it better have a good justification.",Ripple

However, using some of these criteria, it’s easy to conclude that certain crypto projects are better than others. One might suggest there’s value under the hood if one believes in the long-term growth drivers underpinning these networks.


Here are three tokens representing undervalued cryptos worth considering right now.

The SEC’s silence on spot Ethereum (ETH-USD) ETFs has dashed hopes for May approvals, with chances downgraded to 35% by experts. A number of analysts suspect Chair Gary Gensler’s cautious approach influences this delay. Despite regulatory silence, the market’s sentiment concerning Ethereum remains optimistic, anticipating eventual approvals given past positive stances on the commodity-like asset.

Additionally, the upcoming Dencun upgrade revolutionizes Ethereum’s data storage, enhancing accessibility and reducing costs for layer 2 transactions. Comprising nine Ethereum Improvement Proposals, the upgrade promises near-free layer-2 transactions, potentially shifting Ethereum’s activity to these networks. Projects might incentivize usage by absorbing gas payments, making transactions even cheaper.

Lastly, Ethereum is a crucial Web3 crypto asset alongside Bitcoin, valued for portfolio stability. It pioneered smart contracts and hosted a large share of the total value locked in the world of decentralized finance (DeFi). Significant upgrades such as the EIP-1559 further the thesis that it’s one of the undervalued cryptos worth buying at current prices, particularly on this recent dip.

Ripple (XRP-USD)

We all know how cryptocurrencies work: through simple supply and demand dynamics. Buyers are here willing to pay a price, while sellers are willing to accept trades, taking profits when a given token rises.

However, it’s different for Ripple (XRP-USD) because this token relies on its utility created via the Ripple Ecosystem. This exposes investors to a revolutionary technological infrastructure to improve cross-border transactions. Compared to other traditional systems, Ripple is adapting near-instantaneous transactions. This alone presents an excellent opportunity for innovating payment systems worldwide.

Ripple’s rapid cross-border transaction capabilities hold promise for global banks, particularly in emerging markets. With a pre-mined token supply and potential for long-term adoption, XRP’s value could certainly be under-appreciated.

Short-term price fluctuations depend on market dynamics, but a rally to $1 is plausible with growing interest in cryptocurrencies. The outcome of Ripple’s legal battles could significantly impact XRP prices. A dollar-cost averaging approach mitigates risk, enabling gradual investment accumulation at varied price points for potential future gains.

Cardano (ADA-USD)

Cardano (ADA-USD), a Layer-1 intelligent contract network, achieved a milestone by launching Mehen’s USDM, a fiat-backed stablecoin. The USDM token, issued by Mehen Finance, is 1:1 convertible to U.S. dollars and can be transferred on Cardano without additional intelligent contracts. Mehen announced the onboarding process for institutional customers, with USDM expected to arrive on-chain during the week of March 18.

Cardano’s ecosystem growth marks a significant milestone with the launch of USDM, the platform’s first fiat-backed stablecoin. Unlike other algorithmic or synthetic stablecoins, Mehen’s USDM is fully backed by U.S. dollars at 1:1. Users deposit USD into their Mehen account, which is stored separately for token holders to mint equivalent USDM tokens. This drives about a 37% quarter-over-quarter and 673% year-over-year increase in Cardano’s stablecoin value.

Cardano’s proof-of-stake consensus ensures eco-friendly operations, countering concerns over crypto’s energy usage. This sustainable approach aligns with growing ESG investment trends, distinguishing Cardano in the market. Development focuses on the upcoming Chang hard fork, empowering ADA holders, followed by the Basho phase and significant partnerships like the recent UAE agreement.

The decline was triggered by higher-than-expected inflation data and profit-taking by some traders, with some analysts predicting further losses before a potential rebound.

Crypto market capitalization dropped 7%, its sharpest fall this year, as bitcoin {{BTC}} plunged 8% in the past 24 hours to wipe weekly gains and kickstart a marketwide decline.


Bitcoin slumped from Thursday’s high of $73,000 to as low as $65,800 early Friday before slightly recovering. Meanwhile, Coindesk 20, a broad-based index of most liquid cryptocurrencies, was down 8.25%.

Ether {{ETH}}, Cardano’s ADA, BNB Chain’s BNB and XRP showed similar losses, while volatile meme coins dogecoin {{DOGE}} and shiba inu {{SHIB}} fell 13%. Solana’s SOL tokens were the only major token in green, up 1% since Thursday.

The sell-off started during the U.S. trading hours on Thursday as the February Producer Price Index (PPI) came in 0.6% higher, doubling the pace in January and doubling economist forecasts, dousing hopes for a rate cut in May.

Data shows that crypto-tracked futures suffered over $800 million losses, the second-largest figure this year. Longs, or bets on higher prices, suffered $660 million in liquidations, likely contributing to the sharp downturn. Liquidation occurs when an exchange forcefully closes a trader’s leveraged position due to a partial or total loss of the trader’s initial margin.

Meanwhile, some traders warned of further losses in the coming weeks before an eventual price rebound.

“New historical highs are a trigger for selling,” shared Alex Kuptsikevich, FxPro senior market analyst, in an email to CoinDesk. “Some players are taking profits, which raises the question of whether there will be enough hot buyers at current levels or whether the majority will prefer to wait for a deeper correction.”

“In a corrective scenario, the $65.0-65.5K and $60.0-60.5K areas are of particular interest, as they contain important round levels (significant for retail) and the 76.4% and 61.8% Fibonacci retracement lines,” Kuptsikevich added.

SEANA SMITH: Bitcoin touching a record earlier this week. You can see back above $72,000. Now, the currency hovering at that milestone level. So what's ahead? We want to bring in ""Yahoo Finance's"" Jared Blikre for a closer look that of what we are looking at this morning.

Jared, there is a decent amount of green on your screen there.

JARED BLIKRE: Yes, there is. And Ethereum, OK, it's down about one-third of a percent. Let me just point out the number holding above $4,000. And if I put a five-year chart on, that's what you got to take a look at. More like a three- to five-year chart.

So you can see those highs that we had in 2021. It is marching right back in there. And it's not just Bitcoin. It's not Ethereum. Let me show a Bitcoin chart real quickly. You can see Bitcoin having eclipsed those highs. Look a little bit different than Ethereum.

But we've also seen some other tokens. Some other-- the altcoins come back. Here is Ripple up 12%, 13% over the last 24 hours. Let me show you a two-month chart, because it had a big up day yesterday. You can see it's up about 23% over the last two months.

So lagging Bitcoin, lagging Ethereum. But that's a trend that I've seen. A lot of these smaller tokens like Litecoin. Besides yesterday, when's the last time I said Litecoin? It's been forever. That had a huge day. That's now catching up. Up 34% over the last two months.

And we've also seen some action in the stock. But there have been winners and there have been losers. In fact, let me show you a one-month chart. We got MicroStrategy. That's doing very well. That's up over 100%. They have doubled their price. Coinbase up 70%. Robinhood, up a very respectable 37%.

But you can see a lot of losers down here. Riot Blockchain down 28%. Bakkt down 41%. So it's a game of have and have nots. Also, in the ETF space, where we had all these spot Bitcoin ETF rushing to market, guess what, two of the Bitcoin funds that just launched in January have some of the highest flows that we've seen all year. And that's considering the entire universe of US ETFs.

So you have two S&P 500 ETFs grabbing the top spots that's VOO, IVV. That's BlackRock and Vanguard offering. Then we have iShares, their Bitcoin offering. Then we have Fidelity. So that's $10 and $6.2 billion in flows already this year.

So this is just a very fast growing asset class. I would remind people GLD, the gold ETF, launched in 2004, very fortuitous timing, echoes of that right here with Bitcoin.",Ripple

Ripple (XRP-USD) has not risen above $1 since 2021. Yet, right now, the attractiveness of its low price makes it a candidate for an early purchase.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

Recently on social media, former Ripple CEO Sean McBride spoke of the company’s efforts to make the Ripple coin a reliable cross-border currency. The results of this work are evident in the improved attitude of the World Bank, its recognition and attention to XRP. Such a position can change the views of users and erase concerns about the token’s performance.

This year, there have been shifts in terms of exceeding key moving averages. However, even amidst the surrounding bullish sentiment, XRP still hasn’t exceeded its annual high of more than $0.8. This indicates the coin’s untapped potential. As the alt-season heats up, the price record may be broken.

In February, Ripple acquired Standard Custody & Trust Co. By doing so, the company has expanded its licensing and achieved trust status in New York. Its list of services has grown to include asset tokenization. This move is in line with the company’s overall strategy. According to Ripple President Monica Long, the crypto company is looking to expand its infrastructure offerings for financial institutions.

Also, RippleNet is pleasing the platform’s supporters. At the beginning of the year, the number of payments per day exceeded the expectations of even ardent XRP supporters. The figure of 5 million was 25 times higher than the standard values and demonstrated a high interest in this cryptocurrency.

Algorand (ALGO-USD)

Algorand (ALGO-USD) prioritizes decentralization and security when building its blockchain platform. The project ensures that no entity has full control over the network. Recent improvements have led to the introduction of dynamic round time.

In this way, Algorand increased network throughput and reduced blocking time. This led to the overall strengthening of the blockchain as an effective tool for developers. Also, they were excited to learn that the platform supports Python, which makes building and deploying applications even easier.

The middle of 2023 was not easy for ALGO. The token dropped below $0.09 and fell out of favor with many investors. However, in the last 3 months of the year, it managed to gain $0.15. Now, the March figures raised the bar, with ALGO approaching $0.3.

Algorand plans to block 2.5 billion tokens to be distributed as participation rewards. A 2x smaller amount will be used to support the ecosystem. With this resource, the project will control inflation and increase the deficit. As an additional factor, there is a grant from the Algorand Foundation to improve compatibility with Ethereum (ETH-USD). A cool $10 million will be used to strengthen the connection between these networks. ETH has crossed the $3800 mark. ALGO’s price will react with a delay, but the rise promises to be no less exciting.

The last 7 days have brought the Shiba Inu (SHIB-USD) token an increase of more than 200%. Also, the main meme coins experienced an upswing, but SHIB outperformed its competitors.

The coin’s tripling in value can be explained by its reputation as a highly volatile tool for rapid growth in a bull market. So, the project’s market capitalization crossed the $26 billion mark on March 5. At the same time, the daily trading volume reached $12.3 billion. That surpasses the indicators of Solana (SOL-USD), Cardano (ADA-USD), and Polygon (MATIC-USD).

The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is stable, the token is trading above its 30-day moving average, and it meets the criteria for the best cryptos under $1 to buy. Experts note that $0.00004729 is a resistance level. If it is overcome, SHIB will go to $0.00005939 and $0.00008514.

Despite significant achievements in market performance, the platform continues to develop. The Shib Name Service is one of the latest developments. Like the Ethereum Name Service, it helps to simplify adaptation and improves user experience. Participants use words instead of sets of numbers and letters (wallet addresses).

Bitcoin (BTC-USD) is the most valuable and important asset in the cryptocurrency space. Fortunately, it is again testing all time highs. That is creating a scenario in which all boats are being pulled higher for these seven cryptos with explosive potential. Further, some cryptocurrencies are expressing signs of their breakout ability at the moment. That’s clearly one sign to watch when attempting to identify cryptos with 5X potential.

Back to Bitcoin. Spot ETFs are here. The biggest cryptocurrency has managed to further integrate itself into the financial landscape. Furthermore, the Bitcoin halving lies ahead. Mining companies will soon be rewarded with half as much BTC as they recently were for successfully mining a block. Scarcity tends to increase prices which is another reason that Bitcoin could quickly flash higher. In turn, the entire cryptocurrency market could be pulled much higher again making it a particularly exciting time for crypto investors.

Cryptos With Explosive Potential: Ethereum (ETH-USD)

Ethereum (ETH-USD) is simultaneously one of the most and least likely cryptocurrencies to return 5X by 2025.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

In order for that to happen the price would have to land somewhere between $15,000 and $16,000. That would roughly triple the all-time high price of Ethereum, which was reached back in November of 2021.

It would also bring the market capitalization of Ethereum above $2 trillion. Bitcoin is currently worth $1.2 trillion and the entire cryptocurrency market is worth $2.3 trillion. In short, there will have to be a massive influx of liquidity into the crypto market in order for Ethereum to quintuple in price by 2025. Is it impossible? No.

For one, Ethereum continues to underpin the entirety of the cryptocurrency space through its dominance in DApps and smart contracts. It is integral to the entire crypto environment. Furthermore, Ethereum will soon be available through spot ETFs a la those that recently were allowed through Bitcoin.

There’s a real possibility that we may be entering another period in which cryptocurrency grows by leaps and bounds. That makes Ethereum a realistic 5x potential crypto despite its already strong price.

XRP (XRP-USD)

Simple pricing history dictates XRP (XRP-USD) has the potential to 5x by 2025. The leading cross border payment facilitation token traded for $3.50 back in 2017. it currently trades for 59 cents, Less than 1/5 it’s former price.

Ironically – and fortunately for investors – XRP has gotten better since then. That is to say that the company behind XRP, Ripple, prevailed in its battle against the SEC. It will not be treated as a security despite the SEC’s dogged fight to prove that it was an unregistered security all along.

Anyway, the worst is behind XRP and it continues to solidify its place as the preeminent cross-border transaction token. With more and more people traveling, the utility of XRP has strong prospects for growth. If you’ve ever tried to send cash across borders you’ll understand that it can be fraught with difficulty. Fees are high and dealing with banks in other nations is inconvenient and complicated to say the least. XRP solves a lot of that with incredibly low fees of a fraction of a penny and settlement times in the range of 3 to 5 seconds.

Those factors should see XRP continue to grow into the future, perhaps on the order of 5x this year.

Cryptos With Explosive Potential: Cardano (ADA-USD)

Cardano (ADA-USD) is simultaneously one of the most idealistic and one of the most realistic cryptocurrency projects that there is. It is focused on the nebulous goal of allowing visionaries to bring about positive global change. That’s an idealistic goal that reverberates throughout the cryptocurrency space. It’s nothing new.

However, Cardano is incredibly realistic in that it governs itself first and foremost through an empirical evidence development process. The project is Guided by the most up-to-date and leading edge computer science information available. In other words, the company doesn’t let its feelings get in the way when it comes to development and instead relies on empirical evidence as a guiding force.

Will that help to multiply cardano’s price by a factor of 5 in 2024? Realistically, I don’t know.

Yet, Cardano has more than doubled since October. Further, ADA has traded for prices that are roughly five times higher than they are currently. The potential is there. Cardano is unlikely to fail for the simple fact that it is among the projects that are least likely to introduce a fatal error into its code. The strict adherence to computer science based evidence is the reason to believe that.

Dogecoin (DOGE-USD)

I’ve probably recommended that investors avoid Dogecoin (DOGE-USD) as many times as I’ve recommended that they consider it. It never had much utility to begin with. Years later, that remains the same.

Regardless, Dogecoin has more potential than most cryptos to increase in price rapidly. In the 24 hour span prior to me writing this, for example, it increased in value by 32%. It’s up by more than 50% over the past week.

Well-known and influential names in the cryptocurrency space are predicting that Dogecoin is mirroring its 2020 behavior. Ali Martinez is a cryptocurrency strategist with a following of more than 43,000 people on X. He recently suggested to his followers that Dogecoin may have the ability to rise by more than 11,000% in the near future. If that were to occur it would make 5x returns appear pathetic by comparison. Whatever the case, Dogecoin  remains an obvious choice for crypto investors willing to chase outside gains.

Cryptos With Explosive Potential: Toncoin (TON-USD)

Toncoin (TON-USD) is a bit different from the cryptos discussed previously in this article. It is different in that it has particularly strong catalysts beyond the broad excitement around cryptocurrency at the moment.

Social media platform Telegram is launching an advertising platform which should create substantial revenues. There is a lot of current speculation that Toncoin will be adopted within that advertising platform. That means Toncoin could be correlated with the rise in advertising revenue. In turn, that holds substantial potential to further increase the price of Toncoin.

Let’s be honest: a lot of the potential in cryptocurrency continues to be based on amorphous ideas and broader speculation that decentralization will continue. Yet, cryptocurrency is like any other business in that revenue is always going to be one of the primary factors in success. Toncoin is now situated to potentially be associated with legitimate and measurable revenue growth. That simple and powerful factor is the primary reason to assume that Toncoin could multiply in value by a factor of 5 by next year.

Shiba Inu (SHIB-USD)

Shiba Inu (SHIB-USD) is very likely to see a lot of liquidity in flow in the coming months and throughout 2024. The project was capable of establishing a strong position as a meme coin and that is a powerful asset. Plenty of meme coins have attempted to replicate its success since then and almost all have failed. Shiba Inu is a unique force despite the fact that it is, like Dogecoin, low utility.

Investors are aware that Shiba Inu is an excellent mechanism for betting on bullish sentiment across the cryptocurrency market. It isn’t a fly by night meme coin, instead it is one that is well established. All I’m really trying to say is that it provides relative stability vis-a-vis other meme coins while also remaining highly capable of capturing quick upward volatility.

That’s particularly valuable at this moment. It’s a Fool’s errand to try and understand the mechanism behind Shiba Inu. Instead, investors should simply understand that it has a history of providing massive gains when the crypto market heats up. That’s its value.

NEAR Protocol (NEAR-USD)

NEAR Protocol (NEAR-USD) is the cryptocurrency of choice for investors who believe that basic platforms can still be developed today. It is what is known as a layer one blockchain. That means it provides the broad environment for DApp development and smart contract creation among other things.

To invest in NEAR Protocol is to say that there is still room for fundamental platform creation and the market for it even in 2024.The project is trying to overcome issues that have plagued other similar projects including that of scalability. It has its own unique consensus mechanism called a ‘doomslug’ that purports to solve that issue.

NEAR Protocol remains interesting for the same reason that Solana (SOL-USD) was interesting in the past few years: speed. It boasts 100,000 transactions per second thanks to something called nightshade technology. The technology breaks blocks into smaller chunks increasing transaction speed in the process. It’s going to continue to be an interesting project to follow for the speed narrative alone.

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bitcoin-miners-show-muscle-pushing-205518590.html,Bitcoin Miners Show Muscle Pushing Back Against Warrantless 'Emergency' Order,"Bitcoiners have struck a significant victory in their push to strike down the U.S. Department of Energy’s statistics unit’s “emergency” bitcoin mining order. According to court documents, the Energy Information Administration is dropping its mandatory survey sent to hundreds of miners in favor of the proper notice and comment period required by law. The EIA hastily announced the order in early February, calling the data request a matter of national importance.

This is an excerpt from The Node newsletter, a daily roundup of the most pivotal crypto news on CoinDesk and beyond. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.

This comes as a response to the lawsuit filed by the Texas Blockchain Council, Riot Platforms, New Civil Liberties Alliance and Chamber of Digital Commerce against the DOE, which in February won a temporary restraining order that limited the government’s ability to collect data. The court overseeing the case wrote that it’s “likely” the justification for the original emergency order request fell “short.”

From the jump, the crypto industry was able to mobilize and call out the shaky justification for the bill. It was a rare moment where, seeing the threat of undue regulatory interference , industry insiders decided to fight back.

For instance, in a CoinDesk op-ed, Lee Bratcher of the Texas Blockchain Council wrote that the data request could easily be politicized and inflame incomplete narratives about how the blockchain industry interacts with the national grid. The New Civil Liberties Alliance said the EIA’s report likely stemmed from “political pressure” rather than a desire to prevent “public harm.”

The EIA is now going to try to get the data — which could be genuinely useful — via means that do not trample on people’s constitutional rights. It will publish a notice in the Federal Register about its proposal and destroy any information already collected, according to court docs.

Notably, the original survey request lacked any information about how the government would protect potentially sensitive corporate information, or whether it would be anonymized if published publicly, which is standard practice for this type of data gathering, Bratcher, who worked in the DOE, said.

More to the point, as Riot and the other plaintiffs alleged in their suit, crypto miners would be “immediately and irreparably harmed by being forced to divulge confidential, sensitive and proprietary information to the EIA.” The survey presented the threat of criminal penalties if the miners failed to respond.

Bratcher said the information gathering could ultimately shine light on an increasingly important sector. But he wishes the EIA would work with the industry to design a more accurate and helpful survey. It should, for instance, ask not only how much energy miners draw and from what providers, but also how their flexible electricity consumption can benefit the grid and incentivize greener sources of energy production.

In Texas, miners work directly with the state grid operator to power down during periods of stress on the network — like during the winter storm in 2021 that left millions without access to power. Which makes it ironic that the justification for the EIA’s emergency order was in part to assess how mining could lead to “public harm.”

See also: Bitcoin Mining Has a Superpower | Opinion

The EIA will now open a 60-day public comment period, beginning on the date of publication of the new Federal Register notice.

While the survey will likely come back in some form, this moment is a real victory for an industry that appears to be in the crosshairs of U.S. officials. Not only do figures like Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and Senator Elizabeth Warren constantly equate crypto with fraud, but, arguably, they’re actively engaged in wiping it off the map.

It’s notable that Warren has been calling to stamp down on the mining sector, and that states including New York are passing moratoriums meant to slow its development. Sometimes, when crypto fights back — like in the case of Ripple vs. the SEC — it’s able to score a win when given a fair hearing in the courts.",Ripple

The price spike came as spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) recorded over $3 billion in cumulative trading volumes on Tuesday, contributing to demand. Some traders also pointed to the bitcoin halving event, expected in April, as a new narrative that causes a pre-halving rally.


Meanwhile, the broader CoinDesk 20 index (CD20) jumped nearly 3%.

Futures bets on lower bitcoin prices took on $25 million in liquidations since Asian morning hours, Coinglass data shows, which may have contributed to the price spike.

Elsewhere, major tokens ether {{ETH}}, Solana’s SOL and XRP gained as much as 3% since Asian morning hours, CoinGecko data shows.

Meanwhile, the fear and greed index, a sentiment metric that tracks the rate of change in asset movement against inherent fundamentals, flashed 82 on Wednesday – implying extreme greed and reaching the highest such level in over a year.


The index is rated on a scale of 0-100, with 0 being the most fearful and 100 being the most greedy. A greedy environment is considered a sign of euphoria, which “means the market is due for a correction,” the index’s developers say.

The asset manager had to quickly scrap the investment at a loss of $834.

Jupiter Asset Management (JUN), the London-listed firm with assets under management of over $65.8 billion, had to scrap an investment in one of the crypto exchange-traded products (ETP) due to a compliance issue, the FT reported on Friday.

Jupiter’s Gold & Silver fund had invested $2.58 million in 21Shares’ Ripple XRP ETP during the first half of 2023. However, the investment was flagged by the company’s “regular oversight process” and was later canceled at a loss of $834, according to the report.

The reason for the cancellation is the divergent crypto regulation in Europe. Jupiter’s Gold & Silver fund is domiciled in Ireland, where crypto investments are prohibited for UCITS funds. Other European jurisdictions like Germany allow investment funds to hold crypto.

UCITS, or undertaking for collective investment in transferable securities, is a set of rules for investment funds laid out by the European Commission.

Jupiter’s crypto investment issue highlights the need for a unified crypto investment framework, even as the start of spot crypto products in the U.S. has fuelled the latest bull run in the crypto markets.

Jupiter did not immediately respond to CoinDesk’s request for comment.

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ripple-buy-york-crypto-trust-150000915.html,Ripple to Buy New York Crypto Trust Company to Expand U.S. Options,"Ripple's acquisition plan to grab a company with a New York trust charter will expand the business it's allowed to conduct in the U.S., potentially letting it move beyond its well-known role as a payments network.

The deal – Ripple's second recent purchase of a custody business – must still be approved by the New York regulator.

Ripple struck a deal to acquire Standard Custody & Trust Co., the company said Tuesday, in order to secure a New York trust charter in an ongoing expansion of its U.S. regulatory licensing.


Despite Ripple's overseas focus and its high-profile legal clash with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which has so far mostly gone against the regulator, the global payments company is still trying to stretch its capabilities in the U.S. The limited purpose trust charter held in New York by the company Ripple is buying will let it offer more in-house services, including to financial firms seeking to tokenize assets. The company is trying to push beyond the payments network it's known for and into other financial products in which their institutional customers can benefit from blockchain technology.

""We want to offer more and more of these infrastructure pieces to these financial institutions,"" said Ripple President Monica Long in an interview with CoinDesk. ""We see this as giving us a lot of flexibility.""

She called it a long-term project, and she said Ripple is also still seeking to complete the rest of its U.S. money transmission licensing.

The deal with Standard Custody & Trust, for which Ripple has declined to disclose terms and which is still awaiting approval from the New York Department of Financial Services, adds a crypto custody and settlement business to Ripple's stable. That would let customers maintain custody with Ripple instead of having to go to an outside partner.

Ripple is known in the U.S. for going toe-to-toe with the SEC in federal court over the regulator's accusations that XRP was a security. Though one judge has largely ruled on Ripples' side, the case will continue to be fought in higher courts. Long said the company's hesitation about the U.S. isn't as much about that specific clash as it's about the regulatory uncertainty over digital assets.

""But the U.S. is a major market, and we believe it's possible for the U.S. to emerge as a leader in driving innovation,"" she said.

This latest Ripple acquisition follows a deal last year in which Ripple bought another cryptocurrency custody firm, Metaco.",Ripple 
https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ripple-must-share-financial-statements-100124835.html,,"A New York judge has ordered Ripple Labs to produce certain financial statements and information on the institutional sale of XRP tokens at the request of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), court filings from Monday show.

The SEC request, made in early January, follows a pivotal judgment in the lawsuit that accuses the crypto firm of selling unregistered securities in the country. Judge Analisa Torres' ruling last July that only Ripple's institutional sales of XRP broke U.S. law was celebrated by the crypto industry as a victory in its efforts to clarify how regulators treat digital assets.

Having found Ripple liable for violations before the lawsuit was filed in 2020, the requested documents will aid Torres in determining whether the court should order injunctions or civil penalties for the period since then and, if warranted, decide how much, the SEC said in its request.

An order signed by Magistrate Judge Sarah Netburn on Monday compels Ripple to hand over financial statements for 2022-2023 along with contracts governing institutional sales since the lawsuit was filed.

Ripple opposed the SEC's request in a Jan. 19 filing, saying it was untimely and that the regulator had ""failed to justify each of its requests on the merits.""

The incident was initially flagged by Blockchain sleuth ZachXBT, who claimed on X that 213 million XRP tokens had been siphoned out of a large wallet on the XRP Leger blockchain. The funds were subsequently laundered through multiple exchanges including Binance, Kraken and OKX.


Ripple (XRP) is the sixth-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, according to CoinMarketCap, and it is the native token of the XRP Ledger, which is a blockchain that specializes in payments. Ripple Labs, the company that built the network, uses it to power tools like RippleNet, its cross-border payments platform focused on financial institutions.

Ripple Labs was sued by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in 2020 over claims that it committed fraud by selling XRP tokens without first registering them as securities.

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/failed-bitfinex-exploit-attempt-billions-064856378.html,"In Failed Bitfinex Exploit Attempt, Billions in XRP Moved","A feature of the XRP Ledger network was used in an unsuccessful exploit attempt on prominent crypto exchange Bitfinex, chief technology officer Paolo Ardoino confirmed in an X post on Monday.

Nearly $15 billion worth of XRP were flagged by on-chain service WhaleAlerts to be moved in an apparent transaction early Monday – amounting to nearly half of the token’s $31 billion market capitalization.


But the actual transfer was just for a few cents worth of XRP, and failed as the sender “did not have enough liquidity,” blockchain data from the transaction shows.


The motive was to seemingly trick Bitfinex into taking the transfer as real, which could have possibly opened the door to a hack. However, Bitfinex’s systems flagged the transfers as a “partial payment,” an XRP Ledger feature that allows a payment to succeed by reducing the amount received.

“Someone attempted to attack @bitfinex via “Partial Payments Exploit”, Ardoino said on X. “Attack failed since Bitfinex properly handles 'delivered_amount’ data field.”

Partial payments are useful for returning payments without incurring additional costs to oneself. These are a known attack vector, XRP Ledger transactional documents show.

“If a financial institution’s integration with the XRP Ledger assumes that the Amount field of a Payment is always the full amount delivered, malicious actors may be able to exploit that assumption to steal money from the institution,” the documents state.

“The malicious actor withdraws as much of the balance as possible to another system before the vulnerable institution notices the discrepancy.”

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/block-finality-crypto-205629755.html,What Is Block Finality in Crypto?,"Ideally, once a transaction has been corectly processed in a financial system, the chance of it being reversed should be slim to none. However, this isn’t usually the case in traditional finance. Blockchain systems, on the other hand, seek to mitigate this discrepancy through block finality.

In this guide, you will learn what block finality is, how it works, and its implications for blockchain networks.


This is partner content sourced from Laura Shin’s Unchained and published by CoinDesk.

What Is Block Finality?
Block finality refers to irreversibility once a transaction has been confirmed and added to a block in a blockchain network. At this point, a transaction is deemed final and can no longer be altered.

This is the reason why transactions on the blockchain are permanent and why it is often referred to as immutable.

Block finality is crucial in blockchain consensus protocols but isn’t always immediate. Block finality and latency work parallel to each other in blockchain networks. This means a blockchain’s finality rate is strongly linked to its latency level, which measures the time between submitting a valid transaction and its eventual confirmation on-chain.

How Does Block Finality Work?
Block finality is achieved differently in proof-of-work (PoW) and proof-of-stake (PoS) networks.

In PoW chains like Bitcoin, block finality is achieved through a distributed consensus mechanism that uses the follow the “longest” chain rule. During mining, a miner may broadcast the same block simultaneously, leading to more than one chain.

At this point, the main chain will have split into different forks, making it difficult to determine the original one. In this scenario, both forks will continue to validate and add new blocks. However, once one of the chains validates a block before another, it becomes the longest chain.

The longest chain is then accepted as having the most valid blocks attached, while transactions mined on the shorter chains are discounted. However, transactions in the rejected chain are probably included in other blocks on the longer chain, achieving block finality.

Block finality in proof-of-stake (PoS) chains differ from one PoS implementation to another. For example, Casper FFG, an Ethereum PoS implementation, achieves finality by introducing validators to confirm the validity of the chain after every 100 blocks. A block is finalized after the approval of ⅔ of all validators.

Tendermint, used by the Cosmos network, achieves finality when any block receives more than ⅔ of the pre-votes and pre-commits. This continues in perpetuity unless ⅓ of all validators become unresponsive.

Types of Blockchain Finality
Four main types of blockchain finality are classified according to the levels of certainty and permanence. They include:

Probabilistic Finality
Probabilistic finality is simply chain-based finality. This is the probability that chances are low for a transaction to be reversed with more blocks added to a chain. Probabilistic finality is achieved when a transaction is in a block mined and included in the longest chain. Probabilistic finality is common in most PoW blockchains like Bitcoin.

Economic Finality
Economic finality is where finality is achieved through financial incentives. The idea behind this is it becomes very expensive for anyone to revert transactions in such a blockchain network. Economic finality is closely tied to POS networks where validators must stake a certain amount of crypto as collateral. Any malicious action could lead them to lose their financial interest.

Absolute Finality
Absolute finality is the highest level of finality. In this system, once a transaction is broadcast on-chain, there is zero chance of it being tampered with or reversed. Blockchain protocols like Ripple and Stellar use federated consensus to achieve absolute finality. The federated consensus relies on trusted validators to confirm blocks and secure the network. Blockchain protocols like Cosmos and Algorand also use consensus mechanisms that help them achieve absolute finality.

Instant Finality
Instant finality is when a transaction is broadcast to a network, instantaneously confirmed, and made irrevocable on-chain. Instant finality is hard to achieve and requires fundamental changes in how blockchains perform consensus and process transactions. That said, decentralized protocols like Shardeum provide almost instant finality with a high level of certainty.

How Does Finality Affect Blockchain Networks?
Blockchain finality is a foundational concept for blockchain’s reliability and stability. Finality assures transactional validity and irreversibility, thus preventing the issue of double-spending by recording the valid transaction on-chain. This way, the digital asset is considered spent and cannot be used again.

Finality is also necessary for the deployment of smart contracts. Smart contracts incorporate the agreement details between transacting parties in their self-executing code. Finality ensures the outcomes of these contracts are predictable and irrevocable.

Decentralized applications use finality to secure their operations and make them reliable. Users are assured that any actions taken with the DApps are safe and permanent.

Final Words
Block finality is a cornerstone of blockchain technology and is essential for the success of crypto transactions. As blockchain technology evolves, achieving fast and secure finality will be essential for future developments.",Ripple 
https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-proven-large-cap-coins-103400166.html,3 Proven Large-Cap Coins With Actual Real-World Utility,"There’s a strong argument to be made that the cryptocurrency market is as strong as ever based on the fear and greed index. However, rather than focusing on the temperature of the market we will be focusing on utility. Real world utility continues to be the differentiating hallmark between large-cap cryptos with futures and those without. The crypto winter put an end to rampant speculation and forced crypto projects to focus much more on real world use cases. Investors quickly understood the danger in playing in the highly speculative world of large-cap cryptos where useless memes led to overnight riches for some but broken dreams and substantial losses for many more. Utility will continue to be in fashion and that makes these projects worthwhile.

Ethereum (ETH-USD) is the second most valuable cryptocurrency for a reason, deep utility. I would argue that Ethereum is even more valuable than Bitcoin (BTC-USD) for that reason. If you’re looking for pure utility then Ethereum has to be your first choice.

Ethereum is the dominant force in smart contracts and web3 development and has carved out a very strong market share overall. Smart contracts are programs stored on blockchains that execute a function when certain conditions are met.  In other words, in order for anything to happen in the cryptocurrency space, a smart contract is necessary.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

Everything that is being developed in the cryptocurrency space is in some form depending upon a smart contract. Thus, Ethereum’s dominant position makes it one of the most utilitarian firms overall.

That isn’t to say that ETH is without problems. It clearly has efficiency and speed problems. However, given its size, it’s reasonable to anticipate that enough resources will be directed toward rectifying those issues that they will be solved.

XRP (XRP-USD)

XRP (XRP-USD) is a cryptocurrency that clearly has high utility and easy to understand use cases in the real world. It’s also the 6th most valuable cryptocurrency overall at the moment meaning that it’s certainly large cap. So, what does it do? XRP’s Main utility is in cross border payments. Individuals and institutions use it to instantaneously transfer funds as fiat or crypto between jurisdictions.

The project is inherently easier to understand than many other cryptocurrency projects. The world is very much used to the idea of sending money from a financial institution in one country to a financial institution in another. And, the transfer of the money from one nation’s currency to another as part of that process.

That’s a much easier use case to understand than blockchain, NFTs and any other number of esoteric cryptocurrency-related ideas. XRP hasn’t surged above a dollar as many expected, despite winning against the SEC but that doesn’t mean it has any less utility overall.

Bitcoin (BTC-USD)

Bitcoin (BTC-USD) Is listed last here for a reason, its utility is controversial. Put more succinctly, many wonder if Bitcoin has any utility at all. It’s easy to make arguments either way in that regard.

Naysayers will say that Bitcoin is nothing more than a Ponzi scheme which has grown wildly out of control. Those who are more optimistic will note that fiat currencies are valuable because of the same decree, the masses have accepted it as being valuable.

Whatever the case it is clear that Bitcoin has become an accepted store of value. Its price is a real representation of that fact. It certainly has real world utility in the fact that you can use it to buy fiat dollars, for one, but also as a means of transaction by itself. The list of goods and services that one can directly buy using Bitcoin continues to grow. That’s as a real world as value gets and gives BTC an edge when compared to other large-cap cryptos.

While I hesitate to focus on any one metric for any investment class, the underlying cryptocurrency market simply doesn’t respond to rational considerations. It appears utterly irrational until you realize the power of the underlying demographic catalyst.

Unlike other asset classes, cryptos represent a decentralized paradigm shift. It’s a purely digital ecosystem, carrying no real connection to the physical world. In other words, you don’t hold certificates of crypto unit ownership in your hands. Rather, your wealth is represented in the binary code of digitalization. And that suits Gen Z just fine. After all, they have no real recollection of the analog past.


Therefore, it only makes sense that the zoomers’ investment of choice is cryptos. Even better, the stiff suits on Wall Street recognize the paradigm shift awaiting them. As Gallup mentioned, the economic boom of the 1980s and 1990s handsomely rewarded the baby boomers.  The same might be said about the digital asset boom for the zoomers.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

Here’s the best part. You don’t have to be a zoomer to participate. Below are key cryptos to watch.

Bitcoin (BTC-USD)

Under “traditional” assessments of Bitcoin (BTC-USD), one might conclude that both BTC and other cryptos are due for a pullback. According to TipRanks’ on-chain analysis, Bitcoin comes in as “mostly bearish.” In particular, the underlying blockchain’s net network growth landed at only 0.24%, a pessimistic signal relative to historical norms.

Also, large transactions – a momentum indicator focused on transactions greater than $100,000 – dipped 3.15%. That might signal lower participation among the whales or the biggest stakeholders of a particular virtual currency. If you want to look at the technical picture, Bitcoin continues to rise higher against fading acquisition volume. Ordinarily, you want rising volume to confirm a rising price action. That’s not happening here.

It might not matter. Over the past 24 hours from early morning Tuesday, BTC gained nearly 7% of market value. Regaining firm command of the $45,000 price level, 50K may not be too far away. Frankly, I don’t know where this money is coming from. All I can say is that Gen Z wants what it wants.

My idea? Don’t fight the tape.

Ethereum (ETH-USD)

Again, under a traditional assessment, Ethereum (ETH-USD) might not be much of a confidence-boost. Sure, its on-chain analysis suggests a “mostly neutral” backdrop. However, that’s not necessarily a riveting description, especially when you’re talking about one of the most exciting cryptos. Plus, some of these metrics are rather poor.

For example, TipRanks notes that Ethereum’s net network growth sits at 0.23%. That’s bearish compared to prior norms. Also, large transactions account for 0.57% of value exchanges in the underlying blockchain. That’s a lot better than Bitcoin obviously but it’s another bearish signal against historical standards. And yes, while Ethereum marches higher, acquisition volume has been slipping. That’s just not a great look in any other context.

However, we’re talking about decentralized digital assets. In the trailing 24 hours, ETH gained over 4%. And in the past seven days, the number two crypto by market capitalization swung up roughly 7%. Looking ahead, I’ve got to imagine that the $3,000 level will soon be in sight. As with Bitcoin, don’t fight the tape.

Tether (USDT-USD)

As a stablecoin or crypto asset pegged to a hard currency (usually the U.S. dollar), Tether (USDT-USD) lacks the impetus if you will of most other virtual currencies. Rather than the buy-low, sell-high directive, Tether enables investors to effectively store their wealth in the blockchain. So, when opportunities arise, investors can simply respond by trading Tethers for whatever cryptos they’re targeting.

Still, in many ways, it’s a high-risk, high-reward proposition. For example, Tether’s website clarifies any misconceptions about its USDT units. They represent digital tokens and are not legal tender. So, don’t bother the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC); they’re not interested in your sob story. Thus, investors expose their wealth to USDT at their own risk. If a digital bank run materializes, you are SOL as the kids like to say.

Subsequently, whether Tether falls below or above its 1:1 peg with the dollar may be symbolic of confidence in the crypto sector. In the trailing one-week period, USDT has mostly traded at or above parity with the greenback. In my opinion, that’s a solidly positive signal for blockchain assets.

Solana (SOL-USD)

Throughout 2022 and much of 2023, questions plagued Solana (SOL-USD). To make a long story short, Solana represents a quicker, more scalable and more accessible – due to lower fees – version of Ethereum. Unsurprisingly, many folks labeled it one of the Ethereum killers. However, the downcycle of cryptos (brought on in part by spiked interest rates) imposed a beating on SOL.

Another factor that clouded Solana – though through no fault of its own – was that it earlier enjoyed the backing of the disgraced Sam Bankman-Fried. Call it guilt by association. However, during the so-called “Uptober” seasonal cycle of cryptos, Solana absolutely skyrocketed. And aside from the normal ebb and flow – and the occasional sharp hiccup – SOL continues to march northward.

It’s hard to argue with the data. Just in the past 24 hours, SOL returned stakeholders more than 11% of market value. As of this writing, that makes it one of the best-performing decentralized assets among the top 10 by market cap.

Looking to the next few weeks, FXLeaders suggests that $160 may be a profit-taking point. Below $120, you still have a scalping opportunity here.

XRP (XRP-USD)

One of the most popular altcoins or alternative cryptos, XRP (XRP-USD) initially started off with a bit of controversy. Founded by Ripple Labs, debate among public forums materialized about whether XRP was truly decentralized or not. However, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) targeted Ripple for a lawsuit alleging securities violations. Suddenly, it seemed as if the entire crypto community rallied around Ripple.

As you know if you follow the blockchain ecosystem, a favorable federal ruling bolstered sentiment for XRP. Almost immediately, the altcoin went vertically skyward. However, with the regulatory agency unwilling to let the ruling stand as is, XRP started to fade. Still, during the Uptober catalyst, XRP found its mojo again. Personally, I think investors should be able to trust the digital asset over the long haul.

From a fundamental perspective, the crypto cat’s out of the bag. On technical grounds, XRP has generally printed a series of higher lows since the summer of 2022. Barring some unforeseen catastrophic event, XRP’s kinetic energy should sustain.

Cardano (ADA-USD)

Another popular altcoin, Cardano (ADA-USD) enjoyed one of the greatest paradigm shifts in the virtual currency sphere in 2023. For most of last year, ADA languished, either slipping sharply relative to other blockchain assets or mired in sideways trading while other coins and tokens shot higher. However, circumstances changed for the better – a lot better – during Uptober.

Adding to the enthusiasm, Cardano continues to impress onlookers. Over the trailing 24 hours, ADA gained nearly 5% of market value. In the past week, it swung up a little over 4%. At the moment, the crypto coin trades hands for around 63 cents. Just a month ago, you could have bought Cardano for less than 40 cents.

Still, while ADA has already benefited from a significant surge, it’s still possible to scalp some upside from here. Recall that earlier in 2023, some experts called for Cardano to retest the $1 level. In hindsight, of course, that didn’t quite materialize. However, with cryptos enjoying newfound vigor, a buck in ’04 seems a very reasonable target.

Avalanche (AVAX-USD)

One of the other top-performing cryptos ranked among the top 10 by market cap, Avalanche (AVAX-USD) strongly benefited from the recent sentiment pivot in the blockchain. Right now, AVAX trades hands at just over $43. That translates to a 24-hour performance of nearly 12% up. Currently, the total value of the network stands at just under $15.8 billion, good enough for ninth place.

Billed as a layer one blockchain, Avalanche provides a base layer for applications and transactions. Basically, it acts as a foundational infrastructure upon which other applications are built. Specifically, Avalanche seeks to provide a platform for custom blockchain networks. In doing so, it aims to unseat Ethereum, thus representing one of the viable Ethereum killers.

Interestingly, AVAX prints “mostly bearish” on-chain signals, according to TipRanks. In particular, large transaction volume slipped 1.78%, which presents a pessimistic look. However, with 73% of individual unit holders in the money at the time-of-writing price, enthusiasm for Avalanche runs strong.

Looking ahead, the bulls may look to bring AVAX up to $80, the next logical upside target.

In particular, the benchmark virtual currency soared this year, a dynamic that many in the mainstream did not see coming. Per author Brooke Sample, the optimism largely centers on the flexibility of financial technology (fintech) platforms.

That’s a valid point and one that helps open access to cryptos to watch across the world. However, what may be the pivotal catalyst for the blockchain ecosystem is demographic realities. Back during the 1980s and 1990s, many baby boomers bolstered their wealth through the equities market because that was when they entered their prime earning years.


By logical deduction, the same catalyst could materialize but for cryptos to watch. Millennials have certainly expanded their earning power. And many of the oldest members of Generation Z have entered the workforce. More than likely, they’re going to invest in what they know and love.

That’s cryptos, my friends. Subsequently, the virtual currency sector could see significant gains in 2024, warranting a closer examination of the below digital assets.

Bitcoin (BTC-USD)

What it is: Launched in 2009, Bitcoin (BTC-USD) is the original digital currency. Fundamentally, the underlying peer-to-peer technology facilitated instant payments. Not only that, the mechanism forwarded “trustless” transactions or exchanges of wealth that required no centralized intermediary.

Relevance: Over the past few months, anticipation has built regarding a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF). Intriguingly, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) set forth a deadline of Dec. 29 for ETF applications to finalize their filings, according to a Cointelegraph article. Another potential catalyst for BTC is a halving event expected in April 2024. Basically, the event will reduce miners’ rewards for validating blockchain transactions, thus better ensuring BTC’s scarcity.

Pros: Currently, BTC enjoys a strong technical posture, with the price noticeably above its 50-day moving average. Also, the nearer-term average runs well above the 200 DMA (which sits at around $31,500).

Cons: Since October, acquisition volume of BTC has been slipping, which is not what you want to see. Instead, you’d like rising volume to confirm a rally.

Ethereum (ETH-USD)

What it is: Billed as an alternative peer-to-peer network, Ethereum (ETH-USD) enables the transfer of digital assets directly with other people. Put another way, we’re talking about trustless transactions. More importantly, Ethereum forwarded the concept of smart contracts, or the ability to coordinate and make agreements via trustless platforms.

Relevance: As with Bitcoin, much anticipation exists regarding a possible spot Ethereum ETF. However, according to another Cointelegraph article, the US SEC is pushing back its decision on several ETH funds to May of next year. That’s not exactly surprising that presumably, Bitcoin will be the first of the cryptos to watch to enjoy a spot ETF. With the complexities involved with the underlying smart contract mechanism – not to mention the proof-of-stake protocol – an Ethereum fund brings additional complexities.

Pros: ETH presents a solid technical profile, though it’s choppier compared to BTC. Notably, Ethereum continues to run above its 50 DMA, which is well above the 200 DMA.

Cons: A common concern among many cryptos to watch is, acquisition volume has been fading, in this case since November.

Tether (USDT-USD)

What it is: A stablecoin, Tether (USDT-USD) operates under a different “ethos” than most other cryptos to watch. Because Tether is pegged on a one-to-one basis with the dollar, the point here isn’t about extracting capital gains. Rather, by storing wealth in the blockchain medium, crypto investors can respond immediately to new opportunities.

Relevance: Let’s face it – with cryptos, people are interested in attaining massive wealth in the shortest time possible. Achieving a peg to the dollar doesn’t exactly sound like a path to riches. However, one can extract significant insights into the blockchain ecosystem by assessing the value of the peg relative to the greenback. Notably, in the trailing one-week period (through early Tuesday morning), USDT has spent most of its time above the 1:1 ratio.

Pros: The above trading dynamic for USDT suggests greater relative demand for cryptos than fiat currencies. That should be a positive for digital assets.

Cons: Analytics from TipRanks suggests neutral sentiment for USDT, suggesting that investors should be cautious about “over-interpreting” the matter.

Solana (SOL-USD)

What it is: An alternative smart contract specialist, Solana (SOL-USD) features a blockchain platform designed to host decentralized, scalable applications, per Investopedia. Per the official website, thousands of nodes operating independently validate transactions within the Solana network. Further, the SOL ecosystem attracts blockchain developers for its low costs.

Relevance: It’s probably no hyperbole to state that Solana has quickly become the most impressive digital asset among major cryptos. Earlier, SOL languished under technical selling pressure. However, that narrative changed dramatically during the so-called “Uptober” cycle. It has rarely looked back since then. Remarkably, SOL gained 51% of market value in the trailing seven days. That makes it the fourth-most valuable virtual currency with a market capitalization of $49.3 billion.

Pros: Technically, SOL may have breached a critical milestone. Now that newcomers recognize the profitability power of cryptos, sentiment should remain robust.

Cons: After skyrocketing, some profit-taking may occur. Therefore, investors just arriving may want to adopt a cautionary approach.

XRP (XRP-USD)

What it is: Developed by Ripple Labs, XRP (XRP-USD) is a cryptocurrency designed to facilitate quick transactions as well as microtransactions. Initially, XRP garnered some notoriety because critics claimed it wasn’t a purely decentralized asset. However, those criticisms faded when the SEC launched its suit against Ripple. Then, it became a fight for legitimacy of decentralized assets.

Relevance: Naturally, XRP became a rallying cry for blockchain advocates following the SEC’s accusation that it was a security, not a cryptocurrency. Subsequently, a favorable federal ruling saw XRP skyrocket in July. Nevertheless, the value of the asset began falling quickly as the regulatory body continued to fight back. Arguably, that could have been the end. However, XRP has been marching steadily higher thanks to investors’ resolute support.

Pros: While XRP has occasionally dipped below its 50 DMA, the overall trajectory appears positive. Also, the price action has stood consistently above the 200 DMA.

Cons: As with many other cryptos, XRP’s acquisition volume has faded since November.

Polkadot (DOT-USD)

What it is: An exciting blockchain initiative, Polkadot (DOT-USD) is a protocol that connects various decentralized networks. This capability allows value and data to be transmitted across previously incompatible networks. Given the significant relevance, Polkadot is known as one of the Ethereum killers. Effectively, the network enhances the possibilities of decentralized technologies.

Relevance: With young people investing heavily in cryptos, Polkadot offers an attractive psychological advantage. Fundamentally, the underlying network distinguishes itself via its connectivity attributes. From a market perspective, DOT currently trades hands at around $9. On a per-unit basis, it’s cheap enough for young investors to acquire a significant amount. At the same time, it’s not too cheap that it becomes ridiculous.

Pros: Obviously, one of the immediate pros is its stratospheric run. In the trailing seven days, DOT gained nearly 31% of market value. Also, the rally has been accompanied by a conspicuous rise in acquisition volume.

Cons: Having jumped so far, so quickly, concerns exist about holding the bag.

Avalanche (AVAX-USD)

What it is: Another candidate among Ethereum killers, Avalanche (AVAX-USD) prioritizes scalability and transaction-processing speed, per Investopedia. Like some of the other alternative cryptos or altcoins, AVAX has been on the run since the Uptober cycle. At one point in October, AVAX was trading hands below $9. Now, it’s trading near $46.

Relevance: What makes Avalanche a relevant player among virtual currencies is the very real possibility of rivaling Ethereum. In recent years, blockchain advocates have discussed the prospects of the flippening, a theoretical event where Ethereum overtakes Bitcoin as the biggest cryptocurrency. However, if we’re diving into the theoretical, the dramatic mobility of altcoins suggests that ETH alternatives like Avalanche could eventually slide into the number-two slot.

Pros: It’s pretty clear that AVAX has garnered the support of retail investors given its stratospheric rise. With more young people participating in cryptos, AVAX could be a viable long-term investment.

Cons: Technical indicators suggest that Avalanche is extremely overbought so caution is necessary.

The combination of these factors have led skeptical investors who still advocate for the currency to identify a coin’s utility as the primary characteristic of its longterm potential. Additionally, investors are also starting to consider ISO compliance as another key characteristic of these future-leading cryptos.

Following their guidance, let’s look at three frontrunners to become the next big crypto to buy.

Quant (QNT-USD)

Interoperability is more than just an early focus for utility development, it’s also the feature is where cryptocurrency Quant (QNT-USD) has made its name. The thinking here is simple: the development of the space will lag behind the longer projects operate in individual vacuums. In order for Web3 to succeed in the way that the internet has, connectivity is of prime importance.

Quant facilitates the development of decentralized applications (dApps) that are used to connect disparate blockchains. This powerful concept has caused many investors and pundits to fixate on Quant early on. It is analogous in a way to the HTML markup language that allows the internet connectivity that we rely on today.

Further, Quant is also ISO-compliant. ISO compliance, at its most basic level, means that a given asset meets the globally accepted standards that govern our current financial system. Being ISO-compliant confers obvious benefits. In particular, ISO-compliant cryptocurrencies are inherently more trustworthy in the speculative market, and in turn, have a much better chance of receiving strong demand.

Hedera (HBAR-USD)

Logically, Hedera (HBAR-USD) was always highly likely  to lean into ISO compliance. Given that Hedera is a strong enterprise-first cryptocurrency, its focus on ensuring ISO-compliance is not surprising.

Without doubt, enterprise-utility is Hedera’s strength. It’s the reason that investors continue to be interested in the coin, and its validity has been proven through mutliple case uses at the enterprise level. As a result, large corporations looking to dip their toe into the cryptocurrency space have called upon Hedera again and again. Thus, Hedera has managed to carve out a name for itself in this niche.

Since ISO compliance only strengthens that notion, Hedera makes my list of frontrunners for the next big crypto to buy.

Ripple (XRP-USD)

Ripple (XRP-USD) has always been utilitarian at heart. The company has a long track record of being used in cross-border payments and remittances.

Being useful in the real world has never been Ripple’s problem. Instead, up until recently, it has been defined by its battle with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Previously, the SEC had charged Ripple with operating XRP as an unregistered security. Ripple vehemently denied that charge and ultimately was vindicated in its court battle against the SEC.

Today, Ripple and XRP have entered a new era. It’s a very quiet and utilitarian cryptocurrency used to help people transfer money from one country to another. Overall, it isn’t a controversial project.

Ultimately, I think the fact that Ripple and XRP are ISO-compliant will help more and more potential users come to understand what the company really is. In time, that should create more demand due to its strong utilitarian characteristics and ISO compliance. And while Ripple was undoubtedly tarnished the charges by the SEC, it has a strong opportunity in to market its utility and ISO compliance to drum up demand in the future.

The filing showed up on the website that registers investment trusts in Delaware, but BlackRock didn't file it.

XRP spiked as much as 13% before falling back down.

The cryptocurrency XRP rallied as much as 13% late in the day on Monday before paring those gains after a fake filing for a spot XRP ETF surfaced.


The filing had named BlackRock on Delaware's Division of Corporations, even though BlackRock had not submitted the filing, Bloomberg first reported.

XRP was up slightly on Tuesday morning, trading around $0.66.

The fake filing comes several weeks after a similar event drove the price of bitcoin up. Last month, a report incorrectly stated that the Securities and Exchange Commission had approved BlackRock's application for a spot bitcoin ETF. The crypto spiked briefly before coming back down.

Though the XRP filing was fake, the brief rally is unsurprising as optimism has been building in recent months over the possibility that the US could see its first spot crypto ETF. BlackRock last week registered for a spot ether ETF and is among many firms in line waiting for approval of the first spot bitcoin ETF.

Other Wall Street mainstays including Fidelity have applied for SEC approval on related products, and several high-profile investors like Michael Saylor and Mike Novogratz remain bullish that the US will get a spot crypto ETF this year.

Cryptocurrencies have had banner year, with bitcoin and ether, the largest tokens by market cap, gaining 120% and 70% respectively year-to-date.

The collaboration will open three new blockchain-based payment channels between Onafriq users in Africa and three of its partner firms, namely U.K.-based fintech firm PayAngel., Abu Dhabi-based digital Wallet Pyypl that serves users in the GCC and Australia-based payments company Zazi Transfer.

The payment channels will enable users to execute low cost remittance and business payments to recipients in 27 countries across Onafriq’s pan-African network.

The new payment channels will utilize Ripple Payments, an XRP-enabled payments technology, to eliminate the lengthy transfer times and high costs associated with traditional remittance payments, Ripple said in a press release on Tuesday.

“Connecting our partners PayAngel, Pyppl and Zazi Transfer with Onafriq over Ripple Payments will bring the benefits of faster and more cost-effective cross-border payments to individuals seeking to send money into Africa from around the globe,” said Aaron Sears, senior vice president of global customer success at Ripple.

The rally punctuated the end of a volatile week for crypto investors, who found reasons to cheer a series of legal developments, market chatter, and rumors involving the SEC, which is attempting a widespread crackdown on the crypto industry. The regulator has sued a number of big players, including Coinbase (COIN) and Binance.

The first development came last Friday when media reports suggested the SEC wouldn’t appeal a court ruling that improves the chances that asset manager Grayscale Investments will be able to launch a spot bitcoin exchange-trade fund.


Asset managers have for years been trying to convince the SEC to approve a spot bitcoin ETF, which would allow investors to get exposure to the world’s largest cryptocurrency without having to own it. The SEC had denied the various applications, arguing the products were vulnerable to market manipulation.

""Once the SEC announced that they would not be pursuing an appeal, we saw a very compelling bid,"" Sean Farrell, a digital asset analyst with Fundstrat, told Yahoo Finance.

Then on Monday a rumor circulated that giant money manager BlackRock (BLK) had received new SEC approval for a spot bitcoin ETF, and that pushed bitcoin near $30,000. Prices pulled back when BlackRock denied it.

The SEC is still considering applications from BlackRock, Grayscale, and a number of other asset managers; investors expect the agency to rule on the applications by Jan. 10.

""The time is right for a spot bitcoin ETF,” Bitwise chief investment officer Matt Hougan said on Yahoo Finance Live earlier this week. Bitwise is among the companies seeking SEC approval.

""The SEC has previously been worried about market manipulation, about a lack of maturity in the market, but the bitcoin market of today is not the bitcoin market of a few years ago.""

The new rally in digital assets over the last 24 hours was triggered by an SEC decision on Thursday to dismiss its charges against Ripple co-founders Brad Garlinghouse and Chris Larsen, who were sued for helping Ripple sell XRP.

SEC had argued that the sale of the token amounted to a violation of US law because XRP was not registered as a security with the SEC.

The US judge overseeing the case, Analisa Torres, resolved some claims against the executives and Ripple in mid-July when she ruled that XRP was not a security when it was purchased by the general public.

But she also partly ruled in the SEC’s favor by stating that XRP was in fact a security when sold to institutional investors. She later rejected an attempt by the SEC to appeal her split ruling.

The SEC’s claims against Garlinghouse and Larsen over the sale of XRP to those investors were still scheduled to be tried before a jury, but the SEC said Thursday it no longer wanted to pursue those charges.

The SEC asked the court to give the agency three weeks to confer with Ripple in the hope of establishing a financial settlement tied to its sale of XRP to institutional investors. The SEC declined comment.

Fast Facts:
The SEC will no longer pursue claims that Ripple’s Garlinghouse and Larsen aided the company in violating securities laws related to its XRP transactions.

According to Thursday’s filing, the parties agreed to voluntarily dismiss the aiding and abetting charges with prejudice, meaning that the charges can’t be filed again.

The filing added that the SEC will continue pursuing its claims against Ripple.

In July, Judge Torres ruled Ripple Labs’ programmatic sales of the XRP token to retail investors did not qualify as financial securities. The judge granted the SEC to file an interlocutory appeal until Aug. 18. Interlocutory appeals occur before all claims to both parties are resolved and are only allowed under specific circumstances.

Earlier this month, Judge Analisa Tores rejected the agency’s interlocutory motion to overturn her ruling.

In December 2020, the SEC sued the San Francisco-based technology firm and its executives alleging that Ripple’s sale of XRP was an unregistered securities offering.

Oct. 19 court filings indicate that both parties volunteered to dismiss the case with prejudice, preventing the SEC from rehashing the charges at a later date. The move also terminates a jury trial scheduled to adjudicate the case next year.


The SEC filed its complaint against the pair in December 2020, accusing Garlinghouse and Larsen of aiding and abetting $1.3B worth of unregistered securities sales since 2013 in the form of XRP tokens.

XRP is up 8% in response to the news, according to CoinGecko.

Ripple and SEC To Discuss Penalties
However, Torres also found that $728.9M worth of XRP sales to hedge funds and other accredited investors breached the law. Court filings indicate Ripple and the SEC will meet to discuss appropriate penalties for the illegal transactions, before presenting to the court.

Major tokens, such as XRP, Solana's SOL, BNB Chain's BNB have stabilized after being in the red.

Crypto markets seemed to stabilize in the past 24 hours following a nearly week-long drop as ongoing geopolitical conflicts seemed to weigh down on prices of riskier assets.


Markets slumped since Monday as traders priced in rising oil prices and a drop in traditional equities as the turmoil could impact international trade, analysts told CoinDesk.

Bitcoin hovered just over the $26,8000 mark after losing 3% in the past week, with ether (ETH) traded over $1,500 after a 5% weekly hit. Other major tokens stabilized after seeing some losses: XRP and Solana’s SOL had dumped as much as 8%, while BNB Chain’s BNB and dogecoin (DOGE) had performed slightly better with a 3% loss.

Some analysts opined the current price action observed in bitcoin markets was not necessarily bullish or bearish, and pointed to an equilibrium among buyers and sellers instead.

“Bitcoin has recently been in a building phase, neither particularly bullish nor bearish,” said Andy Bromberg, CEO of Beam told CoinDesk in an email. “At the moment, there's a balance, with few newcomers entering into Bitcoin and equally few exiting,”

“This balance creates a relatively stable price. Significant movement is unlikely to happen until after some sort of catalyst, such as the halving or the introduction of spot ETFs,” Bromberg added.

Traders are eagerly awaiting the approval of a spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the U.S., expecting the offering to open the floodgates to broader institutional demand and an inflow of new money.

Meanwhile, part of Friday’s stability in the bitcoin-led market may have come from confidence in the long-term “quality” asset after an initial sell-off scare.

“After the exuberance of the last few years, we’ve seen a large flight to quality, both in terms of providers and assets,” said Dan O’Prey, Chief Product Officer of Bakkt in a note to CoinDesk. “Bitcoin, being the most decentralized and secure asset, has also benefited from flows from the riskier, long-tail coins.’

Earlier this week, traders told CoinDesk they expected prices to move lower as investors shy away from traditional equities and risk assets in favor of gold and oil – whose prices have gained as much as 6% in the past week.

Crypto markets slumped over 1.6% in the past 24 hours, the CoinDesk Market Index (CMI), a broad-based guage for tracking hundreds of tokens, shows. Ether fell 2.2% to extend weekly losses to over 5%, while XRP tokens led a decline in alternative currencies with a 3% drop.

Among other major tokens, Polkadot’s DOT and Polygon’s MATIC slumped 3%, while Tezos’s XTZ dropped 8%. Render network’s RNDR was the only gainer among large-cap tokens with a 3% gain in the past 24 hours.

FxPro market analysts said in a daily note that bitcoin’s attempt to break the $28,000 level last week triggered a “wave of selling that took the price back to $27,000,” with the profit taking suggesting investors were not keeping their money held up in risky bets just yet.

Bitcoin (BTC) showed signs of stability relative to other tokens, losing 1% in the past 24 hours and hovering above a key support level of $27,500 in Asian morning hours Tuesday. Among traders, riskier assets such as technology stocks and bitcoin are in focus amid surging oil prices.

Analysts at trading firm FxPro told CoinDesk in a note that they were watching for a break of the $28,000 level for bitcoin before turning bullish.

“Technically, bitcoin remains in an uptrend but ran into resistance at its 200-day moving average over the weekend,” the analysts said. “All eyes will be on BTCUSD to see if it can successfully consolidate above $28,000, the 200-day moving average. If it does, we can expect a quick rise to as much as $29,500.”

Dunamu submitted its findings to Rep. Park Seong-jung (People Power Party) of the Science, Technology, Information, Broadcasting and Communications Committee of the National Assembly on the 9th, the report stated.

That’s about 879 on average each day. Hackers may have employed a variety of common methods for the attacks, such as email phishing or DDoS, although Dunamu did not mention specifics in the filing.

DDoS, short for Distributed Denial-of-Service, is a cybercrime in which the attacker floods a server with internet traffic to prevent users from accessing connected online services and sites.

“Bitcoin continues to tend to sell on growth, failing to make a fresh attack on the 200-day moving average,” FxPro senior market analyst Alex Kuptsikevich said in a note to CoinDesk. “Bitcoin has recently outperformed the stock market but is now retreating against the buying in the indices.”


“In the short term, bitcoin seems more at risk of falling than rising,” the trader said, adding ether’s bearish performance did little to boost confidence in top tokens.

Ether and bitcoin were buoyed to one-month highs last week as six ETH ETFs went live in the U.S. earlier on Monday, with traders expecting high demand for the products.

However, their performance told a different story. Less than $2 million were traded across the various ETFs on Monday, with poor volumes throughout the week prompting analysts to write down their bullish outlook and pivot to bitcoin investments instead.

Another blow to the SEC's campaign came in August when a federal appeals court sided with an asset manager that hopes to launch the first bitcoin exchange-traded fund over the objections of the SEC.

A panel of judges found the SEC's reasoning for denying the request from Grayscale Investments was ""arbitrary and capricious.""

The agency has two weeks left to request a rehearing for that case.

The SEC has had some victories. Another federal judge, Jed Rakoff, said on July 31 that digital currencies can be considered securities when sold to the general public, contradicting the earlier ruling from Torres. His case involves Terraform Labs' Terra USD token.

Torres on Wednesday said her decision did not conflict with Rakoff's ruling. She has set a trial date in the Ripple Labs case for April 23 of next year.

The regulator can now either settle the case with Ripple before then or motion to appeal again after the trial.

The agency could still try to appeal the entire case following that trial.


The absence of a clear U.S. legal framework for crypto is no bar against pressing fraud charges against FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) said in a filing published early Wednesday morning. Bankman-Fried’s trial began Tuesday. The former CEO of the crypto exchange has pleaded not guilty to allegations he misappropriated customer funds from FTX. Meanwhile lawyers from both sides are still sparring over what evidence the as-yet-unselected jury will be able to hear. The prosecutors are now fighting claims, reiterated by Bankman-Fried on Monday, that the regulatory status of crypto exchanges is relevant.

A new decentralized finance data platform could underpin future regulation of crypto market actors, according to a study released by the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) Wednesday. Project Atlas has initially been used to map out significant international flows between crypto exchanges, said a proof-of-concept report issued jointly with the Dutch and German central banks. “We are developing a new and important public good for central banks globally,” Cecilia Skingsley, head of the BIS Innovation Hub, said in a statement. “Data on cross-border flows are relevant for areas like payments and macroeconomic analysis.”

Fast Facts:
In Tuesday’s ruling, U.S. District Judge Analisa Torres said she found no “substantial ground for difference of opinion” about her initial findings and that she did not agree that an appeal would advance the case toward a conclusion.

While the decision counts as a partial victory for Ripple, it’s not a final decision. The judge set another trial date for April 2024 when the SEC could still try to appeal the case.

In July, Judge Torres ruled Ripple Labs’ programmatic sales of the XRP token to retail investors did not qualify as financial securities. The judge granted the SEC to file an interlocutory appeal until Aug. 18. Interlocutory appeals occur before all claims to both parties are resolved and are only allowed under specific circumstances.

In December 2020, the SEC sued the San Francisco-based technology firm alleging that Ripple’s sale of XRP was an unregistered securities offering. The SEC also implicated Ripple’s executive chairman Chris Larsen and chief executive officer Brad Garlinghouse as co-defendants, accusing them of aiding and abetting Ripple’s alleged violations.",Ripple

Ripple was granted a preliminary approval in June, but now its Ripple Markets APAC Pte Ltd subsidiary has obtained its formal licensing.

The company said in a statement Tuesday that it does about 90 percent of its business outside the U.S. Meanwhile, Ripple has been fighting with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) over its right to operate there. The company won another significant victory in that case on Tuesday, when a federal judge ruled against the SEC’s effort to appeal, so the matter is heading toward a final showdown in an April trial.

XRP’s price rallied about 5% on the news.

District Judge Analisa Torres said in a brief ruling Tuesday that the SEC had failed to meet its burden under the law to show that there were controlling questions of law or that there are substantial grounds for differences of opinion.


The decision isn’t a complete loss for the SEC, though. The judge set an April 2024 trial date for other issues that still need resolution. The agency may still try to appeal the overall case after.


The judge had previously ruled in July that while Ripple violated federal securities laws in selling XRP to institutional investors directly, it had not done so by making XRP available to retail customers through programmatic sales to exchanges. That decision cast doubt on how strongly securities regulators would be able to police crypto.

The SEC announced after July’s ruling that it would file an interlocutory appeal and move to stay any further decision-making as it bid for an appeal court review of Judge Torres’ ruling.

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ripple-cancels-plan-buy-fortress-191045698.html,Ripple Cancels Plan to Buy Fortress Trust,"Ripple said it won't go forward with its outright acquisition of Nevada-based chartered trust company Fortress Trust.

""A few weeks ago, we signed a letter of intent to acquire Fortress Trust – we’ve since made the decision not to move forward with an outright acquisition, though Ripple will remain an investor,"" Ripple's CEO Brad Garlinghouse said on social media platform X (formerly Twitter).


Ripple said on Sept. 8 that it intended to buy Fortress for an undisclosed amount. At the time, a person with knowledge of the matter said the price tag was less than the $250 million Ripple paid for custody firm Metaco in May.

The day before, Fortress Trust disclosed a theft of customers’ cryptocurrency, later revealed to total close to $15 million. It pinned the blame on an unnamed third-party vendor that had fallen victim a phishing attack. CoinDesk later identified the vendor as Retool, a San Francisco-based company with Fortune 500 customers, which had built a portal for a handful of Fortress clients to access their funds. Ripple said the acquisition talks predated the theft, but it accelerated them.

Fortress Trust, which provides financial and regulatory infrastructure for blockchain companies, was formed by Scott Purcell, who has a long history in the industry. He was CEO of crypto custodian Prime Trust until 2020. Years after he left Prime Trust, the company was ordered into receivership after fellow custodian BitGo terminated its proposed acquisition of the firm.

""The Fortress team is incredibly talented, and has built products solving real customer problems. While this outcome is different from what was originally planned, we’ll continue to support them and hope to work together in the future,"" Garlinghouse added.",Ripple 
https://finance.yahoo.com/news/sec-gensler-throws-more-crypto-212301077.html,SEC’s Gensler Throws More Crypto Punches in Congressional Hearing,"The chief of the U.S. securities watchdog fired another public broadside at industry practices, even as his agency is embroiled in court battles with crypto firms.

Chair Gary Gensler was tight-lipped about what the Securities and Exchange Commission will do with spot bitcoin ETFs after its recent legal setback.

U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair Gary Gensler continued his combative stance against crypto ""hucksters"" in congressional testimony on Wednesday, declining to answer the industry's most urgent questions while arguing that digital assets companies have been dangerously careless with customer assets.


In remarks before the House Financial Services Committee, Gensler maintained his consistent criticism of the way crypto companies manage customers’ funds, saying that commingling assets “is a recipe that’s not led to good results.”

And the chief of the securities agency said his agency still hasn’t decided what to do about a judge’s ruling that sent the SEC back to the drawing board on its spot bitcoin exchange traded fund (ETF) position.

“It’s still an active consideration of the commission,” Gensler said in his testimony. ""We have great respect for the courts.""

A judge in the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals told the SEC in August to rethink its view on these applications for bitcoin ETFs. Circuit Judge Neomi Rao wrote that the agency’s rejection in the Grayscale Investments case had been ""arbitrary and capricious."" Gensler’s testimony didn’t reveal what the agency will do next, or when it will act.

Much of the hearing focused on non-crypto issues, including a looming shutdown of the federal government and whether the SEC is focusing too much on climate or other issues. As in previous hearings, Wednesday’s meeting saw an acute partisan divide, with influential Democrats praising Gensler and Republicans alleging he was harming consumers or small businesses.

Rep. Patrick McHenry (R-N.C.), the panel’s chairman, noted the SEC’s “losing streak with the courts” and criticized its “crusade against the digital assets ecosystem” that the congressman argued is causing confusion and “lasting damage” in the industry.

During his turn to question Gensler, he elicited the latest confirmation from Gensler that bitcoin is “not a security.”

Meanwhile, the crypto industry’s business before the agency may be slowed soon. Gensler indicated the SEC is bracing for a potential government shutdown next week, which the chairman said would sap the agency’s staffing by more than 90%.

""Senior leadership would be there, but we'd be down to a skeletal staff,"" he said, suggesting that the day-to-day reviews and approvals of SEC filings will be significantly slowed.

Of the agency’s 5,000-person staff, the hundreds of people who would be working at any time during a closure won’t be paid, Gensler said. “It’s hard on people.”

He declined to answer a question from Rep. Stephen Lynch (D-Mass.) about the SEC’s other high-profile legal dustup in its case against Ripple, when a judge ruled the company hadn’t violated federal securities law in selling XRP to retail investors, noting it was an ongoing matter before the court.

Lynch, who equated the SEC accusations against Binance with the pre-collapse behavior at FTX, also contended that giving the industry a harbor of regulation might perversely leave a firm legally blameless in another implosion.

Gensler responded that any congressional action would have to solve the problem of commingled assets in crypto, saying, “If Congress did anything, it would be separating out those conflicts.”",Ripple

Data tracked by Coinalyze show the early rise from $26,000 was accompanied by an uptick in the spot market cumulative volume delta (CVD), a sign of net capital inflows or net buying in the spot market. Later, the CVD in the stablecoin-margined and coin-margined futures contracts led the market higher.

ETH, XRP and other major cryptocurrencies tracked bitcoin higher, with XRP gaining 1% despite the impending death cross.

The ominous-sounding technical analysis pattern occurs when the 50-day simple moving average of prices dips below the 200-day SMA, signaling a long-term bearish shift in momentum.

XRP's impending death cross is consistent with similar patterns in recent weeks in bitcoin and ether.

Major tokens such as XRP and dogecoin (DOGE) led declines, with drops of 4% in the past 24 hours. Ether (ETH) fell 0.9%, outperforming the general market, as the CoinDesk Market Index (CMI), a broad-based tracker of hundreds of tokens, slumped 1.1%.

Aptos's APT, Chainlink’s LINK and gaming platform ImmutableX’s IMX were the only tokens in the green, rising as much as 6% on various growth – and fake – catalysts.

Analysts at trading firm FxPro told CoinDesk in a note they remain bearish for the next few weeks, expecting prices to reach as low as $23,000 amid the general lack of interest in trading riskier assets and the absence of market-moving catalysts.

However, there’s still hope for bulls. On-chain data platform CryptoQuant published in a weekly note that bitcoin's recent price performance closely resembled past cycles, suggesting that the asset was “likely to remain in a consolidation phase until the 2024 halving event” but hinted at a “significant price increase after the halving.”

“This assessment is supported by various long-term valuation metrics, including logarithmic growth curves,” analysts at CryptoQuant wrote. “There’s also the realized cap of short-term user transactions (UTXOs), which indicates under-valuation and the absence of widespread retail speculation, reinforcing the potential for future price growth.”

But Ripple’s court case with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) delayed airdrop plans: FLR tokens were distributed to XRP holders after nearly a two-year wait, while SGB was delayed even further.

However, due to local laws, holders residing in Japan were deemed “not eligible for this airdrop” by some exchanges. GMO, one of the few regulated exchanges in the country, in an apparent move to keep users happy “decided to issue Songbird airdrops to Ripple holders in Japanese yen.”

BNB, XRP and other alternative cryptocurrencies nursed losses as market leader bitcoin (BTC) showed low signs of euphoria after a key Mt.Gox action was delayed another year, suggesting investors had likely priced in rumors of the delay.


The defunct crypto exchange Mt. Gox pushed the deadline for its repayments to Oct. 31, 2024. The exchange was hacked in 2014, which led to 850,000 bitcoin (BTC), worth nearly $23 billion based on current prices, being stolen.

Some investors expected these sales to influence the crypto market, given early investors were likely sitting on several multiples of their initially invested capital and had incentive to lock in gains.

In a broadcast message early Thursday, trading firm QCP Capital attributed bitcoin's recovery above $27,000 to rumors that the start of the distribution of funds to Mt. Gox customers has been delayed until 2024.

Bitcoin, however, failed to hold above those levels and slid to $26,900 as of European afternoon hours.

Major alternative currencies sold off Thursday as traders likely locked in gains from earlier this week. In the past 24 hours, BNB Chain’s BNB and XRP slid as much as 2%, ether (ETH) shed 1%, while dogecoin (DOGE) was little changed.

Toncoin (TON) dropped 8% after rising 35% in the past week, following messaging giant Telegram’s endorsement of the tokens. Elsewhere, ImmutableX’s IMX tokens rose 30%, dominated by South Korean trading volumes.

Meanwhile, some traders said that data suggested investors were accumulating bitcoin in expectations of a bull market, even as the short-term bearish outlook remained intact.

“Long-term BTC holders are accumulating the coins they sold to short-term investors in the spring, which promises positive prospects for the future, said FxPro analyst Alex Kuptsikevich in a note to CoinDesk. “This is the kind of behavior hoarders exhibit at the beginning of bull markets.”

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-compliant-cryptos-could-massive-184410985.html,7 Compliant Cryptos That Could Get a Massive ISO 20022 Boost,"Investors remain fearful of losing money in the crypto market — it still feels like the Wild West of finance in many regards. That’s why ISO 20022 cryptos compliance is particularly important.

ISO is an acronym for the International Organization for Standardization, which is a non-governmental global organization based in Switzerland. It sets commercial and industrial standards. ISO 20022 specifically is a standard for financial messaging that governs the exchange of financial data. Cryptos that adopt the ISO 20022 standard could soar in price.  


Why? Cryptocurrencies that achieve the ISO 20022 standard benefit from a level of trust that the broader crypto market lacks. The list of such firms is currently quite short, and very much worth considering. Here are seven cryptos to watch now. 

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

ISO 20022 Cryptos: Hedera (HBAR-USD)

Hedera (HBAR-USD) is well-known for being an enterprise-first cryptocurrency. It has established itself as a crypto for corporations that are leaning into the adoption of cryptocurrency. The tide slowly but surely continues to turn in that direction, and more corporations are realizing that cryptocurrency is more than a passing fad. 

Those firms are also cognizant of the fact that fintech is a burgeoning field underpinned by impressive growth metrics. It’s very much a case of first adopters standing to benefit the most. Thus, Hedera is likely to have a lot of opportunities moving forward. 

The fact that HBAR is ISO 20022 compliant is a massive advantage. That designation should allay a lot of fear on its part and that of the consumer. After all, it essentially means HBAR is equivalent to the financial system that they are already familiar with. ISO 20022 compliance makes Hedera one of the easiest choices for investors who want to get ahead of that upswell in enterprise crypto adoption and it’s very inexpensive. 

Quant (QNT-USD)

Quant (QNT-USD) is set to grow for a few reasons that crypto investors should not ignore.

First of all, Quant has defined utility as the focus of its development. It is developing interoperability of multiple blockchains. Quant essentially facilitates the development of decentralized applications (Dapps) that connect individual blockchains. So, Quant has utility and that is vitally important these days. Investors have been burnt by meme coins and have understandably grown skeptical. The idea of utility first is catching on, benefiting Quant. 

Secondly, Quant is ISO 20022 compliant. That only adds to its overall appeal. It has further distinguished itself from the junk that characterized the first wave of cryptocurrency adoption. It’s another clear signal to the market that Quant is serious about building a network that will create deep value for investors. Investors are going to become increasingly more focused on interoperability as time goes on. Quant is an important part of that conversation and that’s a big part of why it’s highly valued currently.   

XRP (XRP-USD)

Investors are understandably confused about XRP (XRP-USD) at the moment. Ripple, the company behind XRP, prevailed in its court battle against the US SEC. It is not a security and thus not subject to the SEC’s purview. That’s a big win for the crypto market overall and Ripple in particular. However, the victory hasn’t propelled XRP prices to new levels as many expected. Instead, it briefly spiked prices which ultimately served to benefit lucky traders. The remaining investors are wondering what to hope for next. 

That catalyst could be ISO 20022 compliance. XRP is compliant already. It’s also well-known for its utility in cross-border remittance and allows users to send money quickly and inexpensively. XRP is a better solution to high bank fees for the transfer of one to another and it’s fast.  It’s also part of the established global standardized financial system. The US SEC victory hasn’t resulted in sustained higher prices but XRP has strong assets including standardization with which it can market its future growth. 

Stellar (XLM-USD)

Stellar (XLM-USD) is pretty similar to Ripple in most regards. Its utility is in cross-border remittances done quickly and cheaply. It is also ISO 20022 compliant. The same general ideas that apply to Ripple and XRP also apply to Stellar and XLM. Utility, ISO compliance, and the opportunity that future standard implementation presented make it valuable. 

It’s fair to assert that the financial system of today is becoming more and more open to crypto. Adoption and integration seem like a foregone conclusion at the rate things are going. Stellar isn’t engaged in a particularly exotic business. Cross-border remittance is everyday business and XLM won’t face difficulty for that reason. The traditional financial system understands its business and familiarity breeds acceptance. That makes it highly likely that Stellar will get adopted quickly by the masses. The quicker the company gets the word out about ISO 20022 compliance, the better. Just like XRP, XLM has a valuable marketing asset in that regard. 

Cardano (ADA-USD)

It’s unsurprising that Cardano (ADA-USD) is currently ISO 20022 compliant. It is known for its focus on an evidence-based approach to its development. It’s all about following emerging computer science and adopting expert opinions to guide its decision-making process. That drastically increases the odds that Cardano creates a network that produces long-term value while avoiding fatal errors along the way. It is the proverbial tortoise that gets ignored which is why I expect it to gain recognition slowly but steadily. 

It adroitly ticked the ISO 20022 compliance box as part of that development. If you’ve been following what Cardano does, that makes sense. It is being developed with the goal of long-term success as the primary purpose. It isn’t some rogue meme coin that has the potential to rise meteorically. That makes it dull to some investors. However, as a result, it is equally unlikely to flame out in dramatic fashion. 

Algorand (ALGO-USD)

Algorand (ALGO-USD) is another inexpensive crypto that boasts ISO 20022 compliance. Like all the other cryptos on this list, compliance lends it a distinct advantage in terms of future growth. By 2025, all financial institutions will have to be able to process ISO-compliant payment transactions. That benefits Algorand and every other crypto in this article. 

Algorand itself is a blockchain supporting financial and non-financial applications. Developers are building Dapps that facilitate both on its network. Its ISO 20022 compliance means it benefits the financial realm in the same way that all the others here do. 

Logically, that could create a sort of virtuous cycle for Algorand: Once the standard is implemented, ALGO will see increased use which will spur its financial Dapp development. In turn, its non-financial Dapp development will see more interest simply because it is part of what the company does. ALGO is among the cheapest cryptos on this list which makes it inherently interesting.

The primary focus of Verge (XVG-USD) is privacy. The crypto emphasizes transactional anonymity by blocking IP addresses and locations. I can see a ton of upside in Verge because it merges the benefits of anonymity with compliance. 

Too often, detractors focus on privacy coins as being the playground of criminals. There are many other reasons users want to remain anonymous. However, that argument has been effective and prevented privacy-first cryptos from gaining broader acceptance. 

Verge is ISO 20022 compliant. It plays by the rules set out by the current financial system. It’s therefore difficult to argue that Verge is designed with illicit activity in mind. 

Here’s the other thing to keep in mind: XVG costs $0.003 right now. It traded for $0.22 back in 2017. There’s obviously no guarantee that it will reach that level again in the future. However, if it does that equates to more than 7,000% returns. It’s entirely possible that XVG could reach that price as a privacy-first, ISO 20022-compliant cryptocurrency.

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/phishing-attack-cloud-provider-fortune-203750644.html,Phishing Attack on Cloud Provider With Fortune 500 Clients Led to $15M Crypto Theft From Fortress Trust,"When Fortress Trust disclosed a theft of customers’ cryptocurrency last week – later revealed to total close to $15 million – it pinned the blame on an unnamed third-party vendor.

CoinDesk has identified that vendor, which has acknowledged it fell victim to a phishing attack. But the story may be more complicated than just a single party’s blunder.


The vendor is Retool, a San Francisco-based company with Fortune 500 customers, which built the portal for a handful of Fortress clients to access their funds, people familiar with the matter said.

The theft, which helped spur Fortress to agree to sell itself to blockchain tech company Ripple, occurred as a result of a phishing attack, they said.

When asked to comment, Retool referred CoinDesk to a Wednesday blog post detailing – without naming Fortress – how it had notified 27 of its customers on Aug. 29 that “there had been unauthorized access to their accounts” as a result of a phishing attack.

The attackers targeted “a specific set of customers,” all of whom were in the crypto business. However, Retool said customers that configured its software the way it “encourage[s]” them to consider doing (“if security is important”) were not affected, and that the vast majority of crypto customers use the product that way.

“We’re glad that not a single on-premise Retool customer was affected. Retool on-prem operates in a ‘zero trust’ environment, and doesn’t trust Retool cloud,” the blog post said. “It is fully self contained, and loads nothing from the cloud environment. This meant that although an attacker had access to Retool cloud, there was nothing they could do to affect on-premise customers. It’s worth noting that the vast majority of our crypto and larger customers in particular use Retool on-premise.”

Even though customers have been made whole, the theft from Fortress customers has been the talk of Crypto Twitter this week, with industry leaders pointing fingers at each other and several prominent companies caught up in the affair. But Retool’s role in the affair has not previously been reported.

Crypto vulnerabilities
The situation highlights a challenge that the cryptocurrency market, the way it has evolved, faces along with the traditional finance industry: There are numerous potential points of vulnerability, and problems often crop up because of some unexpected flaw somewhere in the system.

While $15 million is not an insignificant sum, it is a relatively small percentage of the billions of dollars worth of overall assets that Ripple says Fortress holds on customers' behalf. To help Fortress make customers whole, Ripple has made a $15 million “down payment” on its yet-to-close acquisition of the Nevada-based trust company, one person with direct knowledge of the situation said. The payment is a small fraction of the total purchase price, this person said.

A Ripple spokesperson said Fortress covered most of the affected customers but Ripple “stepped in to make the rest of those customers whole,” and all customers were covered within a week.

Theft ‘accelerated’ M&A talks
Fortress disclosed the security incident in a tweet on Sept. 7, but did not identify the “third-party vendor” whose cloud tools it said were compromised. The Nevada trust company stated at the time that there had been “no loss of funds.”

The next day, Ripple, which was already a minority investor in Fortress, announced it had signed a letter of intent to buy the custodian outright.

The companies were already in takeover talks when the theft occurred, but the incident accelerated them, a spokesperson for Ripple told CoinDesk in a statement on Monday.

“Conversations accelerated last week following the security incident via a third-party analytics vendor, but this opportunity makes sense for Ripple in the long term,” the statement said. “Luckily, Ripple was in a position to act quickly to step in and make customers whole, and there have been no breaches to Fortress technology or systems.”

Fortune reported the size of the theft to be in the range of $12 million to $15 million earlier Wednesday, citing Fortress co-founder and CEO Scott Purcell.

BitGo, Fireblocks, Swan
Fortress used wallets provided by Fireblocks and BitGo, neither of which were themselves breached, according to all three companies.

""The breach happened outside of the Fireblocks’ platform,” the company, known for using multi-party computation tools, told CoinDesk in a statement. “Due to Fireblocks’ key management system, authorization and policy engines, the size and reach of the impact on customer funds were drastically limited and customer funds were promptly restored.”

Mike Belshe, the CEO of BitGo, emphasized that the breach “has nothing to do with” his company in a tweet that criticized Fortress for its handling of the affair. (Fortress co-founder, Chief Technology Officer and Chief Product Officer Kevin Lehtiniitty responded to those criticisms in a tweet of his own.)

Swan Bitcoin, a brokerage firm that uses Fortress’ BitGo wallets to hold client funds, said in a tweet that the coins stored there “did not move during the reported incident at Fortress. The coins are protected by video calls and physical access, and are not subject to any incidents at Fortress.”

The Nevada Financial Institutions Division, the state regulator overseeing Fortress, was notified of the incident on Sept. 1, an agency spokesperson told CoinDesk.",Ripple 
https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bitcoin-steady-26k-sol-slightly-193013190.html,"Bitcoin Steady at $26K, SOL Slightly Dips After FTX Gets Approval to Sell Crypto","The price of bitcoin (BTC) has remained steady Wednesday above the $26,000 level as FTX obtained approval to sell its crypto assets from a bankruptcy court and slightly higher-than-expected headline inflation data in the U.S.

The largest crypto asset rose to $26,350 during U.S. afternoon hours, but slightly retraced after the FTX news. It recently changed hands at $26,135, down 0.3% over the past 24 hours.


Solana's SOL also advanced earlier today, but then swiftly dipped more than 2% following the court decision. The imploded exchange holds $1.16 billion of the token, stoking fears about dumping, but part of the stash is locked as venture investment and not available for sales. Despite the decline, SOL was still up 1.2% for the day.

Aptos (APT), another large holdings of FTX, dropped nearly 2% on the news, but retained most of its gain being up 3% through the day.

Ethereum (ETH), Cardano (ADA), XRP prices are little-changed
Other major cryptocurrencies moved roughly in line with BTC. Ether (ETH), Cardano's ADA and Ripple's XRP remained little changed, sliding less than 0.5% during the day.

Crypto exchange Huobi announced today that it has rebranded to HTX, which sent the exchange's HT token almost 3% higher before giving up some of the gains.

Toncoin (TON) surged near 10% on the news that messaging app Telegram endorsed the TON network as its blockchain Web3 infrastructure with plans to integrate it into the app. TON has retraced most of the move but was recently still up 1.7%.

The CoinDesk Market Index (CMI), a broad market proxy, was up 0.2%.

U.S. inflation above expectations
The U.S. government's Consumer Price Index (CPI) report for August also came out Wednesday, and the data was slightly hotter than expected. The report showed headline inflation rose to 3.7% on a year-over-year basis from 3.2% a month earlier. That jump was greater than economist forecasts for 3.6%.

Behind the inflation advance were rising oil prices, which hit a new 2023 high late last month, a move that has continued into September.

Stripping out food and energy costs, core CPI fell to a 4.3% in August from 4.7% in July and in line with expectations.

What's next for BTC's price
It's been nearly one month since bitcoin suffered a dramatic decline, falling from about the $29,000 level to below $26,000 in just a handful of hours.

Since then, the crypto has attempted to break out of a tight area surrounding $26,000 on a number of occasions – both to the upside and the downside – but has quickly retreated or bounced back to that range.

The action of traders ""selling the rip and buying the dip"" has become so entrenched over the past several months that it's hard to imagine any marginal economic news affecting this dynamic. While bulls hope the U.S. Federal Reserve might soon begin cutting interest rates, the economy continues to grow and inflation appears to be settling in for a long period above the central bank's 2% target.

While BTC has been remained steady around the current price levels, some analysts highlighted the deteriorating technical picture for the largest cryptocurrency.

""Bitcoin’s technicals are sliding. Price is trading around support at $26,000, but I doubt it is a hard floor,"" Charlie Morris, chief investment officer at ByteTree Asset Management, wrote in a Wednesday market update.

He expects that BTC will trade in the range between $20,000 and $30,000 until the halving around next April. ""We just have to wait for better times,"" he concluded.

""We expect an imminent final decline to close out the quarter at the lows,"" QCP Capital said Tuesday in a Telegram update. The crypto trading firm said that a series of negative news over the next weeks such as a more hawkish Federal Reserve meeting next week, FTX asset sales and Mt Gox fund repayment could push the price down to around $23,000.

""The true bottom will come in mid-late October when the bad news cycle has run its course,"" QCP added. ""We nonetheless remain bullish following that, into year-end and Q1 next year.""",Ripple 
https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bitcoin-ether-lose-key-support-003157224.html,"Bitcoin, Ether lose key support levels; altcoins slide amid FTX liquidation woes","Bitcoin fell on Tuesday morning in Asia to hover above US$25,000 after briefly losing the key support level for the first time in the past almost three months. Ether also slid to lose control of the US$1,600 support level. All other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies also booked losses, with XRP leading the losers with a 24-hour drop of more than 5%. The drop came ahead of a potential FTX liquidation that could see the collapsed crypto exchange sell its US$3.4 billion worth of crypto assets by the end of the year. U.S. stock futures edged lower, after Wall Street logged daily gains on Monday, as investors await key U.S. inflation data this week.

Bitcoin briefly falls below US$25,000
Bitcoin dropped 2.72% in the last 24 hours to US$25,115.32 as of 07:30 a.m. in Hong Kong, down 2.57% for the week, according to CoinMarketCap data. The world’s largest cryptocurrency dipped to its lowest price since June 15, touching US$24,930.30 on Tuesday morning.


Ether saw a bigger loss, dropping 4.31% to US$1,547.18 and lost 4.79% in past week, reaching US$1,533.43 on Tuesday, its lowest in six months.

All other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies posted losses in the past 24 hours. XRP led the losers, falling 5.17% to US$0.4727 for a weekly loss of 6.92%.

“The continued decline in altcoin values seems to be linked to the looming approval of FTX’s asset liquidation, a move that could impact the market values of many top cryptocurrencies including XRP, which FTX holds a substantial amount,” said John Stefanidis, chief executive officer of blockchain infrastructure foundation Balthazar DAO.

FTX crypto exchange, which went into bankruptcy in November 2022, is likely to receive court approval on Wednesday to liquidate an estimated crypto holding of US$3.4 billion. The firm proposed to sell up to US$100 million in crypto assets per week, which could be extended to US$200 million.

The incoming FTX liquidation indicates the crypto market could “see another US$3.4 billion in crypto-to-fiat off-ramping — a potential liquidity gap that might be hard to fill in the absence of Signature Bank, Silicon Valley Bank, and Silvergate Bank, which were responsible for at least, 50% of all the fiat-to-crypto on-ramping during the last few years,” Markus Thielen, head of research and strategy at digital asset service platform Matrixport, said in an emailed report.

The event could hit altcoins extra hard, said Thielen, due to “unfavourable tokenomics that compel early investors in projects (founders, Venture Capital investors, etc.) to make prudent financial and survival decisions, and liquidate positions.”

Meanwhile, digital asset investment products saw an outflow of US$59 million in the week ending Sept. 8, marking the fourth consecutive month in a run of outflows that totaled US$294 million, according to a Monday report by European alternative asset manager CoinShares.

Coinshares also highlighted net inflows in short investment products, suggesting “sentiment remains poor for the asset class,” and attributed the grim mood to “continued worries over regulation of the asset class and recent dollar strength.”

The total crypto market capitalization dropped 2.88% in the past 24 hours to US$1.01 trillion as trading volume surged 60.28% to US$32.35 billion.

U.S. stock futures edged lower as of 09:10 a.m. in Hong Kong. All three major U.S. indexes logged gains in regular trading Monday, with Nasdaq leading with a 1.14% increase.

The main stock indexes in Asia were mixed as of 09:30 a.m. in Hong Kong. China’s Shanghai Composite, Hong Kong’s Hang Sheng and South Korea’s Kospi moved lower, while Japan’s Nikkei 225 edged up.

Tesla spearheaded the stock market rally on Monday after Morgan Stanley upgraded the electric car maker’s stock from “equal-weight” to “overweight”, saying the firm’s Dojo supercomputer could add over US$500 billion to its market value. Tesla’s share price surged over 10% on Monday, followed by other technology giants including Amazon (+3.52%) and Microsoft (1.10%).

On the inflation front, the U.S. consumer price index (CPI) for August will be released on Wednesday. Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland expects the inflation gauge to rise 3.8% year-on-year, up from 3.2% in July.

The inflation gauge will provide further insights into the Federal Reserve’s future monetary policies, which aims to curb the annual inflation rate below 2% and in July raised the interest rates to the range between 5.25% and 5.50% — the highest level in the past 22 years.

“This week is more likely to be a ‘good news is good, bad news is bad’ story,” Chris Larkin, managing director of trading and investing at E*Trade from Morgan Stanley, told Bloomberg on Tuesay. “The market’s ability to rebound in the near term could hinge on this week’s inflation numbers, especially Wednesday’s CPI.”

All top 10 cryptos drop
Bitcoin dropped 0.15% to US$25,811 in 24 hours to 4 p.m. in Hong Kong, bringing its weekly losses to 0.56%, according to CoinMarketCap data.

“Currently, Bitcoin’s price is trading without a clear direction amidst cautious market sentiment. Bitcoin, which leads the entire crypto market, will be influenced by various technical factors in the absence of news and legal decisions related to the cryptocurrency market in the coming week,” Rania Gule, market analyst at multi-asset brokerage firm XS.com told Forkast.

“I believe that the crucial support level of US$24,995 will determine whether Bitcoin’s price goes up or down. A clear and strong break below this level would send Bitcoin toward the very important support level at US$24,000, which would indicate a clear bearish trend reversal. In the worst-case scenario, the selling momentum in this case could push the price down to around US$21,915, which is roughly the mid-March level,” Gule said.

Ether, the Ethereum blockchain’s native token, fell 0.78% to US$1,611 in the last 24 hours, and dropped 1.63% in the last seven days.

Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin’s account on X, formerly Twitter, was hacked on Sunday, resulting in losses for some of Buterin’s followers, according to blockchain investigator ZachXBT. Hackers posted links to a scam non-fungible token (NFT) project on Buterin’s Twitter page, advising users to connect their crypto wallets before withdrawing the funds.

“Ethereum price indicators continue to show signals of the ongoing bearish trend, supported by a breach of the trendline that took the price below the critical support level of US$1,687. This paves the way for a potential 27% drop in ETH price. I believe the price could reach a significant level of US$1,200, with intermediate support at US$1,366,” Gule of XS.com pointed out.


The crypto market is also facing downward pressure from the latest FTX news. The collapsed cryptocurrency exchange is likely to receive approval on Sept. 13 to start liquidating its crypto holdings, according to a tweet from blockchain analysts Whale Alert. After filing for bankruptcy in November last year, the exchange still holds an estimated US$3.4 billion worth of crypto assets.

John Stefanidis, chief executive of blockchain infrastructure foundation Balthazar DAO, said, “The recent dip in value of altcoins could be attributed to the anticipated authorisation of the liquidation of assets held by FTX. With a portfolio encompassing billions in cryptocurrency assets, a potential liquidation could significantly influence market values, notably affecting Solana, Aptos, Dogecoin, Matic, TON, and XRP.”

Toncoin was the biggest loser, declining 3.38% to US$1.70 in the past 24 hours, and losing 9.96% in the past seven days.

Ripple’s XRP was the second biggest loser, dropping 2.91% to US$0.4857 on the day and 3.54% on the week. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) submitted a filing last Friday to push the court of the Southern District of New York to appeal its ruling on the agency’s lawsuit against Ripple Labs. The SEC requested the court to review its prior ruling by Judge Analisa Torres that posed “knotty legal problems,” according to the filing. In July, a summary judgment by Judge Torres ruled that Ripple’s XRP sales to institutional investors violated securities laws, but sales on public exchanges to retail investors did not.

Ripple Labs also announced that it will acquire Nevada-based crypto infrastructure startup Fortress Trust, giving Ripple a regulatory license in the state of Nevada.

Elsewhere, the Group of 20 (G20) meeting under India’s presidency, said during the weekend that member countries will work together to develop a coordinated global regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies, cross-border cooperation and information sharing.

“Crypto assets and how regulation can be put in place – we contributed to a roadmap so [that] over the next month progress can be made in that area,” Kristalina Georgieva, managing director of International Monetary Fund said at the conclusion of G20 leaders summit in India’s capital New Delhi on Sunday.


However, one of the key challenges facing the cryptocurrency industry globally is the delay in implementing these recommendations at a national level, according to Caroline Bowler, chief executive of Australian digital asset exchange BTC Markets.

“While international organizations are setting the framework for a harmonized regulatory environment, it is imperative that governments and regulatory authorities act promptly to translate these guidelines into actionable regulations. Delayed implementation could hinder the industry’s growth, create uncertainty, and potentially leave investors and consumers exposed to risks,” Bowler said in an emailed statement on Monday.

Total crypto market capitalization dropped 0.54% to US$1.03 trillion, while market volume gained 36.82% to US$20.63 billion.

Total NFT sales volume dropped 4.08% to US$8,757,370 in the past 24 hours, according to CryptoSlam data. NFT transactions dropped over 10% at the same time.

“As we head into the slowest months of the year one has to wonder how low we can really go, and if we can fall to Feb. 2021 levels where we saw US$35-50 million in sales,” said Yehudah Petscher, NFT strategist at Forkast Labs.

Among blockchains, Ethereum topped the rankings by sales volume, which rose 2.67% to US$4.7 million. Mythos and Polygon networks ranked second and third respectively.

Among collections, Mythos-based DMarket topped rankings although its sales volume fell 7.76% to US$1,012,238 in the past 24 hours.

“Football NFTs were hot with the kickoff of the NFL season. Both DraftKings with their fantasy football NFTs and NFL All Day with their pure collectibles saw millions in sales over the past seven days,” Petscher said.

The CPI prediction of 3.8% is still higher than the Federal Reserve’s long-term goal of bringing the annual inflation below 2%. The Fed last raised the interest rate in July to between 5.25% and 5.5%, the highest since early 2001.

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/sec-counters-ripple-effort-appeal-214600293.html,SEC Counters Ripple in Effort to Appeal Groundbreaking XRP Ruling,"Whether or not Ripple violated securities law in making XRP available to retail investors by putting it on crypto exchanges is absolutely a question that needs appeals court intervention, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) argued Friday.

The SEC filed a response to a Ripple memo which argued the opposite as part of its ongoing case against the crypto company closely affiliated with the XRP cryptocurrency. While Ripple argued last week that the SEC hadn't made a sufficient argument to warrant an appeal, Friday's filing pushed back forcefully.


""The Defendants themselves say that the issues have industry-wide significance and are of special consequence,"" the filing said.

The SEC signaled its intent to appeal Judge Analisa Torres' ruling in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York last month, asking the judge for permission soon after. The judge allowed the SEC to make its case, giving Ripple a September 1 deadline to present its opposition. Friday's filing is a response to Ripple’s opposition memo.

Judge Torres ruled in July that Ripple violated federal securities law in how it sold XRP to institutional investors, but that it had not done so with retail investors. Another judge in the same court, Judge Jed Rakoff, disagreed with the judgment when he ruled on a different case, also brought by the SEC. The regulator pointed to this in its first memo and Friday's filing as part of its bid to convince Torres to allow the so-called interlocutory appeal, allowing an appellate court to take up some legal questions while the case is still progressing in the original court.

""'[Judge Rakoff] did reject this Court’s legal conclusion that the existence of 'blind' trading platform-based transactions precludes the application of Howey, as a matter of law, under virtually identical facts (sales of the crypto asset by the issuer to investors on a platform in blind bid/ask transactions),"" the filing said.

Should Judge Torres grant the SEC's motion, it will need to present its case before the Second Circuit Court of Appeals.

“The crypto ETF opportunity won’t stop at just bitcoin (BTC), but will extend into multiple crypto assets,” analysts led by Gautam Chhugani wrote.


The industry will get its first spot bitcoin ETF some time between mid-October and mid-March, and approval of all spot ETF applications, including Grayscale, will happen at the same time, the report said.

“The industry push for an ether (ETH) spot ETF follows immediately after, given ETH also has a similar market structure of a traded CME futures market and a spot market,” the analysts wrote.

The asset management industry is expected to push beyond bitcoin and ether into areas including other top blockchains, such as Solana and Polygon, and even leading decentralized finance (DeFi) assets, the note said. DeFi is an umbrella term used for lending, trading and other financial activities carried out on a blockchain, without traditional intermediaries.

This is a massive commercial opportunity for the asset management industry to generate healthy fees in a burgeoning asset class, the note added.

“The strong showing in the courts (Ripple and Grayscale in 2 months), improved ETF chances and the progressive institutional interest, are positioning crypto for an unprecedented capital led cycle, unlike the retail led crypto cycles of the past,” the report added.

The SEC is seeking a federal judge's approval to appeal her ruling finding that Ripple's programmatic sales of XRP did not violate securities law. If Judge Analisa Torres, of the Southern District of New York, signs off on the bid, the SEC will need to convince the Second Circuit Court of Appeals to take up the case. In its filing Friday, Ripple argued that there are no controlling law questions and that an appeal wouldn't lead to a faster resolution of the overall case.


July's ruling did not ""present a controlling question of law,"" and neither did the SEC's motion for an appeal, Ripple said in Friday's filing, which added that the regulator hasn't proven that different judges might disagree with the ruling, or that an appeal would lead to a faster end for the court case – all of which are requirements for the judge to approve an appeal, according to the filing.

Judge Torres found in July that while Ripple violated federal securities laws in selling XRP to institutional investors, it had not done the same in making XRP available to retail investors by putting it on exchanges.

A different judge in the same court, Judge Jed Rakoff, disagreed with Judge Torres' assessment in his own ruling in the SEC's case against Terraform Labs, a point the regulator brought up when it filed the substantive part of its appeal on August 18.

In Friday's filing, Ripple said the factual bases underlying each case were different, leading to the different rulings.

""This Court’s summary-judgment ruling relied on record evidence that Ripple made no 'promises or offers' to purchasers in Programmatic Sales,"" the filing said. ""Terraform, by contrast, accepted the SEC’s allegations that Terraform and its founder promised all purchasers – those who bought directly from Terraform or from some other source – 'rates of returns of 19-20% on the coin owners’ initial investment.'""

While the broader market may seem gloomy, I believe there are some seriously undervalued cryptos right now that could make any portfolio shine. When mainstream interest catches up, these underground heroes can suddenly explode in value and deliver outsized returns.

The upcoming Bitcoin (BTC-USD) halving in 2024 and potential Fed rate cuts on the horizon make me bullish on crypto over a long-term horizon. While some speculative assets might fizzle out, I believe blockchain projects solving real-world problems have staying power. Even with recent volatility, it is a good time to position yourself for the next wave of adoption and wealth creation in this asset class.


Here are three unstoppable cryptos long-term investors should consider right now.

XRP (XRP-USD)

The recent legal victory of Ripple Labs over the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has fundamentally shifted the outlook for XRP (XRP-USD). After years of regulatory uncertainty, Ripple has “partially” triumphed, in demonstrating that XRP is not a security. This monumental court decision removes the existential threat that has been hanging over XRP for far too long.

With its status as a non-security now established, XRP is poised to unleash its full potential. As one of the largest and most liquid cryptocurrencies, XRP offers fast settlement speeds, low transaction fees, and scalability advantages over many rivals. Major financial institutions have already piloted Ripple’s payment solutions, leveraging XRP for cross-border transactions.

Now that the SEC fog has lifted, we can expect a surge of new demand for XRP, especially among institutional investors who were previously wary of regulatory risks. Ripple can now aggressively expand its XRP ecosystem now that the existential threat is gone.

Indeed, the stars are aligning for this crypto project right now. The crypto market has been turbulent, but with the SEC drama firmly in the rearview mirror, XRP seems undervalued given its vast real-world utility for payments. For risk-tolerant investors with a long-term horizon, XRP could deliver outsized returns as adoption accelerates.

XDC Network (XDC-USD)

While the relief rally in XRP is grabbing headlines, another crypto innovator warrants attention: XDC Network (XDC-USD). XDC has been one of the standout performers in the cryptocurrency sector of late. Its unique hybrid blockchain combines the permissionless model of public networks with the enhanced performance of private networks.

Several factors are fueling excitement around XDC Network. It has inked high-profile partnerships with organizations like the Australian Trade and Investment Commission, UAE Trade Connect, and the African Digital Asset Framework. These collaborations highlight the real-world traction XDC Network is gaining.

XDC Network has also focused on compliance, shaping regulations, and working with policymakers to make blockchain technology more acceptable to mainstream institutions. In addition, XDC Network has a thriving developer community building dApps, stablecoins, and other crypto products on its blockchain. For instance, the recent launch of the FXD stablecoin adds to the utility of the network. As more developers choose XDC Network, network effects will propel its long-term success. Its outperformance this year could be just the beginning of these network effects being reflected in its price, and I think a continued uptrend is likely as real-world adoption accelerates.

ATOR Protocol (ATOR-USD)

Distinct from high-flying cryptos like XRP and XDC is ATOR Protocol (ATOR-USD), which has delivered stable returns for long-term investors. While the broader crypto market has gyrated wildly, ATOR Protocol has maintained relatively impressive stability. Bolstering the widely-used Tor Network for enhanced internet privacy and anonymity gives this project real-world utility.

The ATOR token serves as the native currency driving the adoption of the protocol. Users must stake ATOR tokens to run Tor Network nodes and receive rewards in ATOR. This creates sustainable, built-in demand for the token.

ATOR Protocol’s returns have outpaced many benchmarks over the last several months. With internet privacy concerns growing globally, ATOR Protocol addresses a massive real-world problem.

Users running ATOR nodes also have the altruistic motivation of supporting internet freedom. As the crypto sector matures, projects with robust utility like ATOR Protocol could outlast short-term fads. While speculative assets rise and fall dramatically, ATOR continues providing steady, outsized gains for investors who believe in its long-term potential. In my opinion, I don’t see a sharp moonshot potential with this token, but rather an investment that can provide a consistent and stable climb higher.

Solana’s SOL was the day’s biggest loser, failing to capitalize on Thursday’s rally fueled by its partnership announcement with e-commerce firm Shopify on Thursday.

SOL erases Shopify boost
Solana’s SOL token fell 4.69% in the 24 hours to 4:30 in Hong Kong to US$20.67, as the day’s biggest loser in the top 10, giving up most of the gains made Thursday, when Solana announced a partnership with Shopify to offer crypto payments via Solana Pay, a peer-to-peer payments protocol built on the blockchain.


The XRP token was the day’s second biggest loser in the top 10, falling 3.18% to US$0.5115, which marks a six-week low for the coin, reversing nearly all the progress made since Ripple’s partial victory over the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) last month.

Bitcoin was little changed during afternoon trading in Asia at US$26,098 as of 4:30 p.m. in Hong Kong after briefly dipping US$25,966 earlier in the day.

The world’s first cryptocurrency has been weighed down by numerous factors, including large holders selling during a low-liquidity period, according to Alex Konanykhin, the chief executive officer and founder of Unicoin, an equity-backed crypto that pays dividends.

“Bitcoin is inherently volatile. Its price can be driven down by negative news or by a large sale, especially in late summer when liquidity is at its lowest.”

Investors are also cautiously anticipating Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell’s speech at the Jackson Hole Economic Symposium on Friday, which may signal more rate hikes or a negative attitude towards digital assets.

“Cryptocurrencies compete with fiat currencies, so a Fed Chairman may not possibly see Bitcoin as anything but a pesky competitor. Chairman Powell is likely to be negative about Bitcoin but it’s nothing new: many regulators have made negative statements about cryptocurrencies,” wrote Konanykhin in a statement shared with Forkast.

Total crypto market capitalization over the past 24 hours fell 1.62% to US$1.05 trillion while market volume decreased 12.34% to US$28.43 billion, according to CoinMarketCap data.

Ethereum’s 24-hour NFT sales rose 11.89% to US$8.67 million, but that of the largest Ethereum-based collection, the Bored Ape Yacht Club, fell 11.33% to US$1.23 million. DeGods sales rose over 309% to US$883,229, making it the third largest NFT collection across all chains by 24-hour sales volume.

Data shows XRP, among the world’s largest tokens by market capitalization, has lost nearly all gains after Ripple Labs’ landmark court ruling over the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in July.

XRP exchanged hands at 50 cents on Wednesday, down 14% in the past week and 30% over a 30-day period. Price-chart data shows the tokens hit a yearly high of 83 cents on July 20, but Wednesday’s prices are back to levels before the SEC ruling.


In 2020, the SEC sued Ripple on allegations that the firm sold unregistered securities. Ripple has historically maintained a distance from XRP, the token that powers some of its products, and the XRP Ledger network. But any progress in the case has an impact on XRP prices.

But in July 2023, a U.S. judge ruled the sale of XRP tokens on exchanges did not constitute investment contracts, putting a pause on what was one of the longest and most controversial legal cases in the crypto market.

XRP (XRP-USD)

XRP (XRP-USD) hasn’t benefited from its SEC court case victory as much as many people expected.

That’s arguably been a massive disappointment. Investors got most of the gains immediately following the decision and it’s almost like it didn’t happen. 

However, the victory was more than just a blip on a price chart. Sure, some shrewd investors got in and out quickly and doubled their money. And yes, those who didn’t sell on the news have seen their capital hardly appreciate at all. So, it’s hard to argue with those who are kicking themselves for not selling. 

That said, XRP is better than it was simply for the fact that it now has more credibility than it did prior. A recent article highlights the fact that merchant adoption of XRP as a payment method has increased following the ruling.

That’s right, utility is increasing and utility is ultimately what will separate the crypto wheat from the chaff in the long run, making this one of the under-$1 cryptos worth watching.  

Cardano (ADA-USD)

Cardano (ADA-USD), like XRP and all other cryptos that have staying power, must ultimately find greater utility.

Fortunately, there’s good reason to believe that the developers of ADA will do so. Cardano’s development is governed by a reliance upon peer-reviewed research and evidence-based methodology. 

When the company refers to this notion it means that major developments will be governed by implementing proven computer science research. I

t isn’t as much about the notion that developers will push for implementing real world utility. In other words, implement the science first and then expand network partnerships second. 

Make no mistake though, Cardano is definitely being designed with utility heavily in mind. The enterprise section of its website sets out its thinking on utility and where it is going.

There is a grand design behind Cardano that is far less buzzword-dominated and much more rooted in economic reality than most other cryptocurrencies. That’s why it’s one of the under-$1 cryptos worth investing in even if the future is very murky at this point. 

Polygon (MATIC-USD)

Polygon (MATIC-USD) costs around 60 cents and has significant potential. It is one of the better-structured layer 2 protocols available.

Layer 2 protocols are those that are built on top of existing blockchains intending to add functionality thereto. With Polygon, the base layer is Ethereum (ETH-USD).

So, Polygon improves Ethereum’s scalability, aka speeds and fees. Polygon has utility. Not so much in the sense of use cases, but in the sense that it improves the second most valuable cryptocurrency. 

And if you can increase the speed of anything while reducing costs thereof value should follow. If the Ethereum network is faster then more developers will create DApps for the network. The same is true as network costs decrease. 

Web 3 gaming companies have grown increasingly interested in Polygon recently. It’s impossible to say what that will lead to but it signifies another avenue for development and potential moving forward. That’s important because crypto, and Polygon, are still finding their footing. 

Dogecoin (DOGE-USD) 
Dogecoin Cryptocurrency

Dogecoin (DOGE-USD) is the antithesis of utilitarian cryptocurrency.  Most investors are well aware of that idea and regard Dogecoin as the joke it was designed to be. 

I have no problem with that. I think investors have to make an exception for Dogecoin. It is the leading non-utilitarian cryptocurrency. I’ve said it many times but DOGE is simply a mechanism for odd, speculative behavior in the market.

It doesn’t have utility because it is money like some of its proponents argue. It has utility because it has established itself as the go-to brand for speculation when crypto behaves in difficult-to-understand ways. That happens often. 

Dogecoin’s creators famously continue to malign cryptocurrency in general. Billy Markus recently said he likes Bitcoin and Ethereum and then compared DOGE to Bitcoin wearing a dog suit.

It seems like he’s trying to draw a very positive comparison between Dogecoin and Bitcoin after repeatedly calling DOGE a joke. Kind of confusing but it is a joke to be sure, just one that has carved out a strange utility in a volatile space. 

IOTA (MIOTA-USD)

IOTA (MIOTA-USD) may or may not be worth buying at $0.14 but it is at least worth considering.

IOTA has a goal of becoming the executing platform for transactions between IoT devices. It’s interesting though given the expectations surrounding the proliferation of IoT devices moving forward. 

The underlying technology confirms transactions through a network of nodes. IOTA is insistent that its node structure differentiates it from blockchains in that it doesn’t have miners and therefore fees.

It’s essentially another iteration of the distributed ledger argument that favors the development of cryptocurrency overall. 

The company also plans to extend its ledger technology into other use case areas. IOTA certainly is marked by a lot of hope and grand ideas.

No one knows where it’ll go but if it can actually integrate itself into IoT transactions there’s clearly a lot of money to be skimmed away. It’s an interesting proposition and there’s almost nothing else that you can buy in the real world that’s as cheap as IOTA so maybe it’s worth a shot. 

Casper (CSPR-USD)

Casper (CSPR-USD) is extremely inexpensive and trades for roughly $0.03. It traded for double that amount as recently as May. That’s probably the best argument in favor of Casper overall: It’s really volatile and gamblers might like it for that reason alone. 

As an actual project, Casper is mostly a buzzword-filled project that has garnered little of a following at this point. The marketing of the project focuses on drawing favorable comparisons between it and other projects.

Casper relies on a proof-of-stake consensus. Thus, mining isn’t required and Casper notes it is 136,000% more energy efficient than Bitcoin. Casper also leverages the experience of its founders at large enterprises to draw parallels between its project and future enterprise utility. It’s a tenuous connection at best. 

In short, I’m not really impressed by anything the company states or does marketing-wise. It’s a cheap gamble worth taking simply because it is so cheap. Nothing more, nothing less until it proves otherwise. 

Arbitrum (ARB-USD)

Arbitrum (ARB-USD) is another Ethereum Layer 2 scaling solution. Therefore, it promises to increase transaction speeds and reduce fees across the Ethereum network. Those goals are inherently valuable and if Arbitrum can be successful, its value will rise as well. 

Arbitrum is also focused on Layer 3 solutions, which are those that enable developers with fluency in computer languages, including Rust and C++ to further develop Arbitrum’s network. The goal is to launch its Layer 3 solution called Orbit this year.

One of Arbitrum’s strongest assets is its leadership team. 

OffChain Labs is the name of the group headed by three former Princeton University researchers with deep experience in computer science. OffChian Labs is leading the development of Arbitrum.

So far, the group has been proficient at raising capital for the project. It suggests a strong network of institutional backers for the project which is often the difference between success and failure.

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bitcoin-ether-stable-last-week-014430327.html,"Bitcoin, Ether stable after last week’s nosedive; XRP leads crypto gains; US stock futures mixed","Bitcoin edged up on Monday morning in Asia to trade slightly above the US$26,000 support level, after sliding over 10% for the week. Ether also moved higher but remained below US$1,700 following last week’s losses. Other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies traded mixed. XRP led the winners, despite the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) moving to challenge a June court ruling in favor of Ripple Labs. Meanwhile, the Forkast 500 NFT index dropped as NFT marketplace OpenSea said it will stop enforcing creator royalties from August 31. U.S. stock futures traded flat after Wall Street logged weekly losses at close of trading Friday.

Baby steps upward for cryptos after painful few days
Bitcoin edged up 0.28% in the last 24 hours to US$26,178.36 as of 07:30 a.m. in Hong Kong, logging a weekly loss of 10.68%, according to CoinMarketCap data. The world’s leading cryptocurrency hit a two-month low of US$25,409.11 on Friday, but held position above the US$26,000 support level over the weekend.


A cool-off of Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) hype in the U.S. could be behind the retreat of the token. That’s the view of James Butterfill, head of research at European alternative asset manager CoinShares.

“The surge in June, spurred by BlackRock’s application for SEC approval of a Bitcoin ETF, led to a noticeable spike in prices,” said Butterfill in a report released Friday.

“However, markets are now coming to terms with the realization that an immediate SEC approval for a Bitcoin ETF in the U.S. is unlikely. It’s noteworthy that current Bitcoin prices have stabilized around levels observed before this announcement,” he added.

The low volume and volatility in Bitcoin, a rise in U.S. treasury yields, as well as concerns over China’s ailing economy contributed to Bitcoin’s sharp weekly decline, the CoinShares report found.

“The outlook for the markets in the forthcoming months presents a blend of opportunities and challenges. It’s anticipated that the U.S. Federal Reserve will refrain from hiking rates further in September,” Butterfill said.

A dovish shift in Fed policy could provide a boost to Bitcoin’s prospects, he added.

“On the flip side, investors are eagerly awaiting the SEC’s verdict on the Grayscale ETF and BlackRock applications in September. Anticipations are that decisions on both applications might be postponed, potentially leading to investor disappointment,” Butterfly said.

Along with Bitcoin, Ether moved up 0.85% to US$1,683.57 but remained 8.50% lower for the past seven days.

The U.S. SEC could approve several ETFs based on Ethereum futures by October 2023, Bloomberg reported on Friday citing unnamed sources. Investment firms Volatility Shares, Bitwise, Roundhill and ProShares have all applied for Ethereum ETF licenses.

Other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies traded mixed over the past 24 hours, but all posted weekly losses. Cryptocurrencies have seen a total liquidation of US$24.91 million in the past 24 hours.

That’s a considerable decrease on the daily losses posted last week during a calamitous downturn in the crypto market. On Friday alone, traders liquidated over US$1 billion in cryptocurrencies, including US$851.94 million in long positions — positions where investors bet the cryptocurrency price will rise. On Monday, long position liquidations stood at US$6.89 million for the past 24 hours, according to data from crypto information platform CoinGlass.

Ripple’s XRP token led the winners, gaining 3.96% to US$0.5408 but plunged 13.76% for the week.

In the on-going legal battle between Ripple Labs and the SEC, Judge Analisa Torres on Thursday granted the SEC permission to appeal an earlier judgement in favor of Ripple Labs. That ruling in late June found that the technology firm’s programmatic sales of XRP did not violate securities laws.

In a Saturday tweet, Ripple’s Chief Technology Officer David Schwartz said the SEC should not be allowed to appeal until the conclusion of the case. He said that, even if an appeal is granted, “the case should still continue and the appeal should run in parallel.”


Ripple will have until September 1 to respond to the SEC’s appeal motion.

The total crypto market capitalization edged up 0.45% in the past 24 hours to US$1.06 trillion, while trading volume fell 13.09% to US$21.67 billion.

OpenSea NFT marketplace to stop enforcing creator royalties
The indexes are proxy measures of the performance of the global NFT market. They are managed by CryptoSlam, a sister company of Forkast.News under the Forkast.Labs umbrella.

The main Forkast 500 NFT index dropped 1.08% in the past 24 hours to 2,327.91 as of 10:20 a.m. in Hong Kong, and fell 5.94% for the week. Forkast’s Ethereum Polygon and Cardano NFT indexes also logged losses, while the index for Solana moved higher.

“The catalyst for this (NFT index drop) was OpenSea’s decision to get rid of royalties,” said Yehudah Petscher, NFT strategist at Forkast Labs, in a YouTube video uploaded Sunday.

OpenSea, one of the world’s largest NFT marketplaces, announced on Thursday it would stop enforcing creator royalty fees, making them optional. The change will take effect from August 31. The platform will continue to charge a 2.5% fee for every transaction.

“(The mandatory royalty fee on OpenSea) was meant to empower creators with greater control over their Web3 business models, but it required the buy-in of everyone in the Web3 ecosystem, and unfortunately that has not happened,” wrote OpenSea in the announcement.

OpenSea’s move received criticism from commentators. In a tweet Friday, Mark Cuban, owner of the Dallas Mavericks basketball team and an investor in OpenSea, described the decision as a “huge mistake” that would hurt the industry.


Not collecting and paying royalties on NFT sales is a HUGE mistake by @opensea. It diminished trust in the platform and hurts the industry. And I say this as an @opensea investor @DevinFinzer

— Mark Cuban (@mcuban) August 18, 2023

Yuga Labs, the creator of NFT collection Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC), responded to the news in a tweet Saturday saying it will gradually wind down its support for OpenSea. “Yuga believes in protecting creator royalties so creators are properly compensated for their work,” the company said.


“What I think will happen is they either reverse their decision, or Yuga Labs may end up launching their own NFT marketplace,” said Forkast Labs’ Petscher on Sunday. While the impact of the decision is only just being felt, he added, it will “change the landscape of NFTs.”

Total NFT trading volume gained 15.60% in the past 24 hours to US$14.76 million, according to data from CryptoSlam. Volumes on the Ethereum, Bitcoin, Solana and Polygon blockchains all logged increases, while Cardano’s volume dipped.

Among NFT collections, Ethereum-based BAYC saw the largest 24-hour sales volume, which rose 45.30% to US$2.02 million. Mythos Chain-based DMarket and Polygon-based DraftKings ranked as the second and third largest collections by 24-hour trading volume.

In terms of single NFT sales, BAYC #8585 sold at over US$255,000 on Sunday, making it the most expensive NFT traded in the past 24 hours. However, its former holder purchased the NFT at over US$1 million in October 2022.

“This seller took a huge loss on this NFT,” said Petscher. “That explains the rising average sale price but also the declining profits.”

China policy stimulus lacks punch

U.S. stock futures edged higher as of 11:20 a.m. in Hong Kong, after the three major U.S. indexes closed mixed on Friday and booked losses for the week.

In Asia, the main stock indexes traded mixed on Friday morning. China’s Shanghai Composite Index and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng logged losses, while South Korea’s Kospi and Japan’s Nikkei moved up.

In the U.S., investors await Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell’s opening speech at the Jackson Hole Economic Symposium on Friday. The Fed’s annual summit is attended by central bank leaders from across the world. Powell’s speech could provide insights into the Fed’s thinking on monetary policy.

“We view the event as a good opportunity for Powell to start laying the ground for the next step in the Fed’s policy guidance: no longer focused on how many hikes to expect, but rather on rates remaining ‘higher for longer,'” analysts at Canadian investment bank TD Securities said in a note viewed by Reuters.

In July, the Fed raised the interest rate to between 5.25% and 5.50% — the highest level since January 2001. Powell said in a statement following the decision that the U.S. central bank will “take a data-dependent approach” in determining its future monetary policies. It did not indicate if there are more hikes in the cards or how long the Fed would keep up its tightening cycle.

The Fed meets on Sep. 19 to make its next move on interest rates. Analysts at the CME FedWatch Tool predict a 11.5% chance for another 25-basis-point increase.

U.S. data to watch in the week ahead includes U.S. chipmaker Nvidia’s second-quarter earnings report, as well as S&P Global’s purchasing manager indexes (PMI). Both are set for release Wednesday.

Meanwhile in China, the country’s central bank cut its one-year loan prime rate (LPR) to 3.45% from 3.55% on Monday morning. However, it kept the five-year LPR unchanged at 4.2%, according to the state media Xinhua News Agency.

The stimulus measure was smaller than the analyst expectation of two 15-basis-point cuts to both the one-year and five-year rates. Commentators said China’s central bank may need to act more decisively to soothe growing fears of a recession.

“Until more forceful policy responses are made available to backstop the contagion risk, we believe Chinese stocks will settle in a lower trading range than we previously envisaged,” Goldman equity strategists wrote in a note viewed by Bloomberg.

Torres, a district judge of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York who presides over the case, granted the SEC’s appeal approximately a month after Ripple’s partial victory in its lawsuit where she ruled that Ripple’s institutional XRP sales to violated securities laws, but public sales on exchanges did not.

“The request for appeal (even if granted) doesn’t change the fact that XRP is not a security. That’s not up for debate/trial. But the SEC continues to claim that Chris and I acted recklessly in believing that XRP is not a security. That’s utter nonsense,” Brad Garlinghouse, the chief executive officer of Ripple Labs, tweeted on Thursday.

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/sec-argue-appeal-groundbreaking-xrp-181153682.html,"SEC Can Try to Appeal Groundbreaking XRP Ruling, Judge Rules","A federal judge has let the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) argue it can appeal against her ruling that Ripple didn’t violate securities laws in making XRP available to retail traders by putting it on exchanges.

Judge Analisa Torres, of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, granted the request for leave to file a motion to file an interlocutory appeal Thursday, giving the SEC until Friday to file the motion itself. The SEC announced it was filing the appeal last week, after hinting it would do so in July.


Ripple has until Sept. 1 to file its response to the motion, and the SEC can reply by Sept. 8. Should the SEC win its motion, it can then ask an appeals court for permission file the actual appeal of the ruling.


A Ripple spokesperson didn't have an immediate comment. An SEC spokesperson declined to comment.

Ripple Chief Legal Officer Stuart Alderoty previously said on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter, that the company opposed the request.

“There is no extraordinary circumstance here that would justify departing from the rule requiring all issues as to all parties to be resolved before an appeal,” he said.

The price of XRP did not seem to react much to the order itself, though it is down roughly 4% over the past 24 hours, according to CoinGecko.

The SEC has a steep hill to climb in getting approval from Judge Torres, said ConsenSys Senior Counsel and Director of Global Regulatory Matters Bill Hughes.

""The legal standard is a difficult one to satisfy, and the particulars of this case also do not help SEC's argument in favor of appeal. In fact, the SEC itself has undermined its current arguments for an appeal by previously indicating that a decision in Ripple does not really bear on any other crypto securities lawsuit. It's unlikely that the court will be persuaded by them speaking out of both sides of their mouth,"" he said. ""And even if Judge Torres does grant their motion, they then have another steep mountain to climb – getting the Second Circuit's approval to file an appeal.""

The appeal process itself won't pause the rest of the case, said Dave Rodman, the founder and managing partner of the Rodman Law Group. However, if the SEC wins approval from both Judge Torres and the Second Circuit Court of Appeals to file the appeal, the circuit court may issue a stay on all proceedings until the appeal has been resolved.

""We think that this cause would probably be stayed given the nature of the determination subject to appeal,"" he told CoinDesk.

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/crypto-investors-now-trade-xrp-115155796.html,Crypto Investors Can Now Trade XRP Options on BIT Exchange,"Cryptocurrency derivatives exchange BIT on Thursday launched options tied to payments-focused cryptocurrency XRP.

The new product will allow users to trade XRP options without having to hold the cryptocurrency, the exchange said in a press release, adding that profits and losses will be settled in the U.S. dollar. Institutional liquidity provider OrBit Markets is tasked with creating order book liquidity.


The new product expands BIT's existing suite of options on bitcoin (BTC), ether (ETH), Cardano's ADA, Toncoin (TON), and Milady Coin (LADYS).

Options are derivative contracts that give the purchaser the right to buy or sell the underlying asset at a predetermined price on or before a specific date. A call option gives the right to buy, and a put option gives the right to sell.

Traders typically use options as hedging tools to mitigate bearish/bullish risks or generate additional income by ""writing"" options on top of their spot market holdings.

""We are proud to become one of the first exchanges making XRP options trading accessible to both institutional and retail traders, enabling long and short for options traders at the same time. We look forward to bringing this product to more traders and investors alike across the globe,"" Justin Buitendam, global head of institutional sales at BIT, said in the press release.

XRP is the world's fifth largest cryptocurrency, boasting a market capitalization of $30.88 billion at press time. The cryptocurrency, just like other alternative coins, tends to be more volatile than bitcoin and ether.

BIT's decision to list XRP options comes weeks after a U.S. District Court, in a highly anticipated hearing in the U.S. SEC's case against Ripple Labs for violating securities law through XRP sales, said that XRP is not a security when offered over centralized exchanges, but is one when sold directly to institutions. The distinction threw a spanner in the SEC's attempts to paint all alternative cryptocurrencies with the same brush.

Since then, several exchanges have re-listed the XRP spot market. More recently, the SEC has asked to appeal the court ruling, injecting renewed uncertainty in the market.

XRP surged over 70% to nearly 95 cents following the July 13 court ruling. Since then, it has retreated to trade at 65 cents at press time, CoinDesk data show.",Ripple 
https://finance.yahoo.com/news/crypto-long-trades-account-90-060000233.html,"Crypto Long Trades Account for 90% of Total Liquidations as Bitcoin, Ether Slump","Bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) futures traders took on some of the largest losses in over a month as prices moved under support levels in the past two days - breaking down from a period of stagnancy.

Bitcoin slumped to just under $28,500 late on Wednesday, marking one of the largest two-day price drops since mid-June. Bitcoin weakness caused majors, such as ether, XRP and solana (SOL) to follow suit, falling as much as 5%.


Liquidations on futures tracking major tokens crossed the $160 million mark in the past 24 hours, pushing to over $320 million in losses since the start of this week. Such losses come amid one of the lowest volatility periods for bitcoin.

Bitcoin futures racked up nearly $50 million in losses, followed by ether at $22 million and litecoin (LTC) at $5 million. Traders of bitcoin cash (BCH), solana, and XRP took on nearly $4.5 million in losses apiece.

Long trades, or bets on higher prices, accounted for 90% of the total liquidations, Coinglass data shows.

Liquidation occurs when an exchange forcefully closes a trader’s leveraged position due to a partial or total loss of the trader’s initial margin. This happens when a trader is unable to meet the margin requirements for a leveraged position or fails to have sufficient funds to keep the trade open.

Large liquidations can signal the local top or bottom of a price move, which may allow traders to position themselves accordingly.

Open interest, or the number of unsettled contracts, rose 1.16%, meaning traded opened more positions but ultimately used significantly lesser leverage – suggesting lesser risk-on sentiment.

Meanwhile, trading firm QCP Capital said in a Telegram broadcast earlier this week that it expected prices to gradually fall lower in the immediate absence of market catalysts. It added that price levels of between $24,000 to $26,000 for bitcoin could be expected in the coming months.”",Ripple

Bitcoin was little changed during afternoon trading in Asia, trading at US$29,397 as of 4:30 p.m. in Hong Kong after it briefly rallied to a weekly high of US$30,144 on Tuesday.


“If Bitcoin holds above US$27,500, it could test US$31,000-32,000. There’s also a pivot at approximately US$28,200, which could prove to be solid support. If it were to hold, the price of Bitcoin could rally and even break out,” Lucas Kiely, chief investment officer of digital asset platform Yield App, told Forkast, adding that we’re in a “bullish scenario.”

“If it does break below the current trendline, it would signal a possible end to a long term uptrend, dating back to the regional banking crisis in the US when Silicon Valley Bank, Metropolitan Bank and Silvergate shuttered.”

In the wider crypto market, Ether fell 0.16% during afternoon trading in Asia to US$1,848, remaining below the US$1,900 support level since July 23.

Solana’s SOL token was the day’s biggest gainer in the top 10, rising 0.92% to US$24.49, followed by the XRP token, up 0.72% in the past 24 hours to US$0.6308.

Litecoin sustained the biggest loss, falling 1.03% to US$83.02, followed by the BNB token that lost 0.57% to US$240.43.

The Forkast 500 NFT index inched up 0.01% to 2,496.49 points in the 24 hours to 4:30 p.m. in Hong Kong and rose 0.89% during the week.

Bitcoin’s 24-hour non-fungible token sales rose for a second consecutive day, gaining 8.35% to US$348,449 with the network remaining the seventh largest blockchain by 24-hour NFT sales volume, according to CryptoSlam.

Ethereum’s 24-hour NFT sales rallied 62.68% to US$13.43 million, propelled by stronger interest in DeGods that saw sales rise 572% in the past 24 hours to US$3.13 million, making it the largest NFT collection across all blockchains. The surge of interest follows yesterday’s announcement of the beginning of season III, which will introduce female DeGods NFTs, get rid of unpopular NFT traits and offer DeGods holders four generative art pieces.

“DeGods Season III was finally fully announced and received a very poor response from the community. Instead of offering a free mint, or even affordable mint, the cost to upgrade your existing NFT to the new Season III art is 333 $DUST, which is around 0.4 ETH,” said Yehudah Petscher, NFT strategist for Forkast Labs.

“When projects like the CyberKongz fail to sell out at 0.25 ETH and are told that’s too expensive in this market, it’s hard to imagine who would think 0.4 ETH would work right now.”

Polygon-native NFT collection DraftKings remained the second-largest collection by 24-hour sales volume for a second day, but fell 11.32% to US$1.15 million, as Polygon remained the second-largest network by 24-hour sales volume, with NFT sales on the network down 14.81% to US$2.04 million. The Forkast Pol NFT Composite also fell 0.61% in the past 24 hours.

Traders in the mainland were concerned about a property crisis, after Chinese developer Country Garden predicted a multi-billion dollar loss for the first half of the year.

The much-awaited U.S. consumer price index (CPI) report was released yesterday, showing that inflation rose 3.2% from a year ago in July, with core CPI excluding food and energy prices also increasing 0.2% for the month, representing the smallest monthly increase in the past two and a half years and matching preliminary estimates.

Most U.S. stock futures fell on Friday, except the Dow Jones Industrial Average futures. The S&P 500 futures index and the tech-heavy Nasdaq-100 futures both posted losses.

Investor sentiment was dragged down by San Francisco Reserve Bank President Mary Daly, who said the Federal Reserve still has “more work to do” to curb inflation, reducing the positive impact of upbeat CPI data.

Prices shot up to those levels for a few minutes at 20:30 UTC on Thursday before immediately reverting to parity with the spot markets on other exchanges.

The bump, which took a few seconds to correct, was likely a result of low liquidity in the hours following a token relisting on Gemini, during which a buyer may have placed an outsized market order — which was filled at an outrageously high price.

As such, XRP traded at levels higher than the broader market for at least a few hours, price chat data shows.

XRP traded at above-market prices on Gemini. (Gemini)
XRP traded at above-market prices on Gemini. (Gemini)
Some market observers opined a seller placed a spoof order at $50 per XRP, which was unintendedly filled by a buyer who may have “fat-fingered” the trade.

Market depth data shows XRP liquidity on Gemini remains relatively low, with only a $37,000 order required to move prices by 2% on the exchange. In contrast, the same price move on Binance would require at least $2.2 million.

The token was relisted on Gemini after July’s court order in favor of Ripple Labs, with a federal judge ruling that the “offer and sale of XRP on digital asset exchanges did not amount to offers and sales of investment contracts.” In 2020, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission sued Ripple Labs on allegations that Ripple sold XRP to U.S. customers without adequate registration.

The SEC said it was seeking ""leave to"" appeal part of a recent decision while other parts of the SEC's case proceed to trial. The regulator said approval of an interlocutory appeal could prevent the SEC and government from needing two trials.


""Specifically, the SEC seeks to certify the court’s holding that defendants’ 'programmatic' offers and sales to XRP buyers over crypto asset trading platforms and Ripple’s 'other distributions' in exchange for labor and services did not involve the offer or sale of securities under [the Howey test],"" the SEC filing said.

A federal judge ruled last month that while Ripple's direct sales of XRP to institutional investors violated securities law, its programmatic sales to retail investors through exchanges did not. The SEC had sued Ripple in 2020, alleging that the firm was selling unregistered securities in XRP.

Judge Analisa Torres, of the U.S. Southern District Court, had tentatively scheduled a trial on other issues that she didn't rule on during the motions for judgement for the second quarter of 2024.

In its filing, the SEC noted that Ripple will have to respond by Aug. 16 (a week from the letter's filing), and proposed filing an opening brief laying out the appeal on Aug. 18. Ripple would have two weeks to respond, and the SEC would have another week to reply to Ripple if the judge signs off on the filing.

The SEC had previously hinted that it might appeal the ruling in a separate case, when attorneys for the regulator urged U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff of the same court to ignore the ruling as he mulled over Terraform Labs' motion to dismiss its own SEC lawsuit.

Fast facts
The Seoul Southern District Prosecutor’s Office recently received a translated version of the ruling on the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s lawsuit against Ripple Labs on the sale of XRP cryptocurrency, a spokesperson for the prosecutor’s office told Forkast via text message on Tuesday.

Seoul prosecutors plan to submit the XRP ruling to the local court to prove Terraform Labs’ Luna cryptocurrency as financial securities. Prosecutors accuse Terraform Labs co-founders Kwon Do-hyeong and Shin Hyun-seung of multiple charges including fraud and unregistered offerings of financial securities.

On July 13, the U.S. Court for the Southern District of New York ruled that Ripple Labs’ programmatic sales of the XRP cryptocurrency did not qualify as the offer and sale of financial securities. However, the court concluded that Ripple’s institutional sales of XRP constituted the unregistered offer and sale of securities.

Dan Sung-han, the director of Seoul Southern District’s joint financial crimes team, said that the latter part of the ruling can be utilized for the benefit of proving Terra’s offerings of Luna cryptocurrency as a breach of securities regulations, according to a Monday report by local news outlet Maeil Business News.

Meanwhile, Terra co-founder Kwon is currently detained in Montenegro for attempting to travel with forged passports, while a Seoul court held the first preliminary hearing for Shin and seven ex-Terra employees on July 10.

Kwon is also wanted in the U.S. under similar charges of fraud, securities law violations and several others related to the collapse. He has said that the charges against him were baseless and politically motivated.

Major Asian equities declined as of 4:30 p.m. in Hong Kong, except Japan’s Nikkei 225. Yet, Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index, the Shenzhen Component and the Shanghai Composite all posted declines.

Investors were anticipating the release of China’s trade figures for last month, with concerns that both exports and imports could extend declines due to a lack of domestic and overseas orders.

U.S. stock futures strengthened during Monday afternoon trading in Hong Kong, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average futures, the S&P 500 futures index and the tech-heavy Nasdaq-100 futures all strengthening.

Traders remained cautious ahead of the release of U.S. inflation data for July, scheduled for Thursday, as this can also signal the path for further interest rate decisions.

On the corporate front, investors are now anticipating earnings from companies like Palantir, BioNTech,  Lucid Group, Paramount Global and Beyond Meat.

European equities fell on Monday, extending last week’s declines, with the Dax losing 0.4% and the pan-European Stoxx 600 index falling below 460 as markets mulled remaining quarterly earnings.

Bitcoin was little changed during afternoon trading in Asia, trading at US$29,027 as of 4:30 p.m. in Hong Kong.


“Despite the chances of a further minor correction, higher timeframe on-chain metrics continue to signal a bull market. When Bitcoin re-ascends to a position above its Realised Price, following an extended period of staying below it, this usually signals the onset of a new bull market,” according to a Bitfinex research note shared with Forkast.

Ether fell 0.76% during afternoon trading in Asia to US$1,828 and declined 2.37% during the past week.

Litecoin was the day’s biggest loser in the top 10, falling 4.73% in the past 24 hours to US$86.11 after successfully completing its third halving event yesterday that reduced miner rewards from 12.5 to 6.25 Litecoins per block.

The XRP token was the day’s second biggest loser, falling 4.69% to US$0.6603.

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-don-t-feel-bad-173623984.html,Why I Don’t Feel Bad for HEX Founder Richard Heart’s Victims,"On Monday, July 31, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed a series of civil charges against Richard Heart, born Richard Scheuler, the founder and relentless promoter of the related Hex, PulseChain and PulseX projects. The associated tokens, which have already been disemboweled by the continued dump after the disappointing launch of Pulsechain, dropped another 50% or more on the news.

The charges come after nearly five years of warnings from crypto watchers that these projects were scams – and the SEC agrees, including fraud amongst the allegations against Scheuler. Notably, that makes this a dramatically different situation than Ripple Labs’ legal battle with the SEC. That case is limited to the question of securities violations, which is why it has been seen as an important bellwether for the broader crypto industry.


This is an excerpt from The Node newsletter, a daily roundup of the most pivotal crypto news on CoinDesk and beyond. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.

But the SEC claims that Richard Heart and his projects are simply frauds. While we haven’t yet seen any criminal charges from the U.S. Department of Justice, those might come later, as they did in the case of Terra founder Do Kwon. Because Richard Heart has clearly been up to no good.

Richard Heart flushed your money (and it all went down)
The most scandalous new claim made by the SEC is that Heart and his allies “recycled” investor funds during the initial presale of HEX, the earliest of the three projects, between 2019 and 2020. This recycling was done via the so-called “Hex Flush Address,” which receives various fees from Hex users, and also acted as a holding address for investor funds during the initial HEX sale.

The SEC alleges that Heart and associates moved funds from the Flush Address to a centralized exchange through a series of obscuring transactions. Heart then allegedly sent that money back to the Hex “Contract Address,” disguised as money from new investors.

This means, first, that actual investment in the Hex project was far lower than it appeared. The SEC claims that recycling constituted 94%-97% of supposed investments sent to the contract address. So instead of the equivalent of $678 million worth of ETH, the HEX presale actually attracted roughly $34 million worth of real investor funds.

As the SEC observes, this fund recycling helped Heart lie about the success of the sale, attracting more victims. It also left him in control of an overwhelming majority of HEX tokens.

(Some may note I’m talking about the HEX offering as a “presale.” Another of Heart’s manipulative rhetorical tactics was to describe it instead as a “sacrifice” somehow tied to freedom of speech. He specifically pitched this distinction-without-a-difference to victims as a way to avoid SEC scrutiny. But as the SEC says in the charges, it was simply a misdirection from the fact that the sale likely violated securities law.)

The recycling allegation is revelatory for a second reason. Who controlled the Flush Address has been hotly debated among Richard Heart’s critics, with Heart continually denying that he was the keyholder. But the SEC claims that this was indeed the case, and is what allowed him to fraudulently manipulate the initial offering.

Don’t fake the stake
The SEC has understandably attracted the ire of crypto advocates this year, but it’s still worth celebrating when somebody over there shows genuine understanding of how crypto works. The Richard Heart charges show this understanding when the SEC calls out Hex for what amounted to an entirely fake HEX “staking” program.

This is another way that Heart seemingly targeted the naïve. In a real proof-of-stake blockchain, staking an amount of tokens is required to become a block validator, or to delegate to a validator. A validator has responsibilities that can include building and confirming blocks. In many cases, this involves real technical skill and substantial work. But Hex’s “staking” program, the SEC makes clear, was not that.

Instead, staking offered high returns (also paid in HEX) simply for locking up a holders’ HEX for a long period of time. After all, for the first years of its existence, HEX didn’t even have its own chain to secure, so “staking” was a non-sequitur. Instead, as the SEC spells out, “staking” incentives were primarily intended to keep HEX tokens off the market. That is, like most purported “features” of HEX, it was meant to manipulate the token’s price higher – something Heart publicly discussed – rather than to actually accomplish anything technically useful or necessary.

See also: The PulseChain Sideshow Tent Is Collapsing | Opinioin

In short, Hex stakers got ripped off twice. Richard Heart sold them worthless tokens for real money – then convinced them to give the worthless tokens back in exchange for a smaller amount of worthless tokens, distributed over time.

Some stakers were even shaken down by yet a third gleefully exploitative design choice. Hex stakers could actually be penalized for not withdrawing their stake on time, and those penalty fees were among those that went to the Flush Address – that is, secretly, back into Richard Heart’s pocket.

‘Number go up’ is not a business model
The SEC also notes that the Potemkin staking program’s advertised returns were not derived from fee revenue being generated on the chain. Notably, this was also the fundamental problem with Do Kwon’s Terra chain, which ultimately rested on subsidized and inflated returns through the Anchor Protocol.

That shared penchant for subsidies and money printing point to a broader parallel between Hex and Terra. They both had wildly flawed financial models that were reliant on leverage, lockups and cults of personality – and both were later credibly accused of being explicit frauds. This was one of the points made by the hosts of the “Crypto Critics Corner” podcast during our interview at Consensus: When something seems fishy on the surface, there’s probably even worse stuff going on under the hood.

Richard Heart also repeatedly said that the main goal of the project was to design an asset that only went up in price. Of course, what’s left unsaid here is that it’s not being designed for anything else. One former Hex investor, posting as @scottcbusiness on the Read.Cash platform, summed up the problem better than I possibly could:

“HEX uses a certificate of deposit in the form of staking to achieve a high interest return. This is considered to be the use case and utility of HEX. Considering staking is really a consensus model, I wouldn't really consider it a utility or use case … I don't consider staking itself as a product. For example, I can stake on Hive, but that's not a use case for Hive, the use case is blockchain integrated social media.”

In other words, no matter how much financial engineering you do, a token with no utility will have no actual organic demand and will eventually go to zero.

This is part of why it’s particularly hard to feel bad for Richard Heart’s victims. While all scams leverage victims’ greed, Heart targeted it like a sniper. His Gucci-draped image and unabashed focus on price meant he collected people who envisioned becoming rich, rather than people who thought critically about the technology or financial models they were buying into.

They’re getting the returns that mindset deserves: investors who bought in after the initial HEX presale have currently lost as much as 99% of their money.",Ripple 
https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bitcoin-only-cryptocurrency-sec-asked-151639357.html,"Bitcoin was the only cryptocurrency the SEC asked Coinbase not to delist, CEO says","The Securities and Exchange Commission asked Coinbase to delist over 200 crypto assets, CEO Brian Armstrong said.

He told the Financial Times that the only token that wasn't targeted was bitcoin.

Armstrong said that complying would spell the end of the crypto industry in the US.

Before the US Securities and Exchange Commission took Coinbase to court, the regulator asked the crypto-exchange platform to delist all tokens but bitcoin, CEO Brian Armstrong disclosed to the Financial Times.


If Coinbase followed through, the recommendation would have halted the trading of over 200 crypto assets. The SEC argued that, aside from bitcoin, each of the cryptocurrencies was an unregistered security.

""We said, well how are you coming to that conclusion, because that's not our interpretation of the law,"" Armstrong told the FT. ""And they said, we're not going to explain it to you, you need to delist every asset other than bitcoin.""

According to him, delisting virtually all its tokens would have led to the end of the US crypto industry, making the choice of what to do easy, he said: ""Let's go to court and find out what the court says.""

With Coinbase's failure to comply, the SEC sued the platform in early June, accusing it of not registering as an exchange and listing 13 traded cryptocurrencies the regulator deemed as unregistered securities.

A day prior, it also sued crypto competitor Binance, also citing the unauthorized sale of securities.

""SEC staff does not ask companies to delist crypto assets,"" a spokesperson told Insider. ""In the course of an investigation, the staff may share its own view as to what conduct may raise questions for the Commission under the securities laws.""

A Coinbase spokesperson said the SEC didn't request that Coinbase delist specific assets, adding that such a request requires a majority vote from the commissioners.

""Per the SEC's own assertion, the views shared in the FT article may have represented the views of some staff at the time, but did not represent those of the Commission more broadly,"" the spokesperson said. ""We continue our discussions with the Commission, but believe that transparent and fair rulemaking and Congressional action, such as bills that we saw gain bipartisan support in the US House of Representatives last week, represent the best path forward for American crypto users and the companies building the cryptoeconomy in the US.""

SEC Chairman Gary Gensler has warned recently that the crypto world is full of ""fraud"" and ""hucksters."" Speaking with Bloomberg TV last week, he said that ""investors should be aware that it's not only a highly speculative asset class, it's also one that they currently should not assume that they're getting the protections of the securities laws – even though those securities laws apply to many of those tokens.""

But in mid-July, the ongoing debate about the nature of crypto assets took a turn against the regulator, when the SEC lost its lawsuit against Ripple's XRP token. Having sued the company in 2020 for failing to register the currency, a US judge said XRP is not a security when sold to the general public but is a security when sold to institutional investors.

Afterwards, shares in XRP skyrocketed 61%, while Coinbase stock rose over 10%.",Ripple

The project started in March with wallet design, and the first stablecoin was minted in July and will run through August, Anson said. The stablecoin will run on Ripple's XRP ledger. Ripple has been providing technical assistance and personnel. In 2021, the country said it would work with Ripple to develop strategies for a digital currency.


""We’ve been distributing PSC (Palau Stablecoin) for three weeks. Today is our first official press release,"" Anson said in the tweet. A further announcement is due on Thursday.


There's no guarantee the nation of 20,000 people, which does not have a central bank and uses the U.S. dollar as its currency, will continue with the project once the test is over.

""We will send a report to the president and congress with recommendations whether or not the stablecoin is a good program for Palau,"" Anson told CoinDesk. ""Next steps after that will depend on what the government authorities authorize.""

The country has also partnered with blockchain research firm Cryptic Labs to launch what it said is the world’s first digital residency program, and once people apply for this they will get a non-fungible token (NFT) representing their resident ID cards that gives them access to Palau-based perks like shipping services and a physical address. It is also working on establishing a crypto exchange, Palau President Surangel S. Whipps, Jr. told CoinDesk in a January interview.

Then, BTC recovered and changed hands at around $29,100.


Major alternative cryptocurrencies — altcoins — also dropped through the day, with Ripple's XRP and Solana's SOL leading the fall. SOL plummeted 6.8% over the last 24 hours, while XRP declined 6.2%.

Ether (ETH), the second largest crypto asset by market capitalization, fell 2.1% over the same period and traded at around $1,840.

Popular dog-themed memecoin dogecoin (DOGE) defied the struggles of the broader cryptocurrency market, jumping as much as 5% before paring some of the gains, CoinDesk reported. Elon Musk-owned social media platform Twitter started to rebrand Monday to X, part of Musk's artificial intelligence (AI) firm X.AI, while Musk added DOGE to his bio, prompting speculation about the token's role in the platform's future.

Worldcoin, the crypto project of Sam Altman, founder of ChatGPT-developer OpenAI, went live Monday with its mainnet launch. Its native token WLD gained some 38% until press time as major exchanges enabled trading with the asset. The CoinDesk Market Index, which tracks the performance of a basket of digital assets, was down near 3% in a day.

Cryptos' stodgy performance veered from major U.S. equity indexes, which rose on Monday, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite and S&P 500, which has a hefty technology component, edging up 0.1% and 0.4%, respectively. The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 0.5% to continue its longest winning streak in six years. Digital assets and stocks have increasingly decoupled this year after largely correlating previously.

Report on Binance.US issues
The WSJ published a report Monday saying Zhao said in an internal message that the exchange's affiliates may have been responsible for trading $70,000 worth of bitcoin on Binance.US' debut in 2019.

""That was ourself, I think,"" Zhao said in an internal message, according to the Journal. Wash trading refers the process of artificially inflating transaction volumes by trading with yourself or an affiliated entity.

Early last month, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed a wide-ranging lawsuit against Binance for violating securities law and alleging that it used Sigma Chain, a company headed by CZ, to manipulate the volume. The U.S. banned wash trading in traditional markets in 1936.

A spokeswoman for Binance, which was founded by Zhao, told the newspaper that neither the company nor Zhao has engaged in or tolerated wash trading. Binance dismissed wash trading allegations in an email to CoinDesk.

“Binance does not engage in or tolerate wash trading, which is a violation of our terms of use, nor has it ever done so. Binance has a dedicated Market Surveillance team that is responsible for reviewing surveillance related to potential abusive and/or manipulative behavior including wash trades and trade price manipulation. The Market Surveillance team utilizes surveillance models and a team of experienced surveillance professionals to detect and prevent market abuse,"" Binance's spokesperson said.

The WSJ's report also said Binance's representative dismissed the SEC's charge as unfounded. Binance is the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume. Thus, regulatory uncertainty surrounding Binance tends to weigh on crypto prices.

China's economic woes
Around the same time, China's ruling Communist Party's 24-member Politburo — its top decision-making body, led by President Xi Jinping – said the country's economy is facing new difficulties and the economic recovery will be challenging. Early this year, analysts widely cited China's reopening of its economy as a major bullish tailwind for risk assets, including cryptocurrencies.

Importantly, Politburo's readout published by the official Xinhua News Agency did not include large-scale fiscal and monetary stimulus announcements.

China faces several issues ranging from weak consumer spending after an early boost following the reversal of covid lockdown measures, deepening deflation in factory-gate prices, and housing and real estate problems. As such, markets have been expecting a strong monetary or fiscal response from Beijing.

Bitcoin, often considered a pure play on fiat liquidity and the riskiest of the risk assets, likely fell on the back of China's growth concerns and the absence of major stimulus hints.

BTC eyes $27,000
The lack of positive catalysts in the short-term and usually muted summertime trading activity could result in a BTC price decline, analysts told CoinDesk.

“If bearish pressure intensifies, the next significant support level would be $27,000, the lower boundary of the rising channel from the November lows and the 200-week moving average,” Alex Kuptsikevich, FxPro senior market analyst, noted in an email.

“Bitcoin is beating a slow retreat at the moment as the price continues to trend down from recent highs,"" said Simon Peters, markets analyst at digital brokerage platform eToro.

The agency said the Ripple decision was wrong in a filing for a different court case against Terraform Labs and its co-founder Kwon Do-hyeong. The filing was in response to a motion by Terraform lawyers arguing the case against the company should be dismissed based on the Ripple ruling.


See related article: After U.S. court rules Ripple XRP is not a security, industry remains cautious

Fast facts
The SEC filed a six-page document on Friday in response to Terraform’s motion for dismissal, stating that: “Respectfully, those portions of [the Ripple ruling] were wrongly decided, and this Court should not follow them.”

“SEC staff is considering the various available avenues for further review and intends to recommend that the SEC seek such review,” the document added in relation to the Ripple ruling.

On July 6, U.S. District Court Judge Analisa Torres ruled that Ripple Labs’ programmatic sales of XRP cryptocurrency did not qualify as financial securities, or the offer and sale of investment contracts.

The ruling was considered a partial win for Ripple, as the court still ruled that XRP sales to institutional investors constituted the unregistered offer and sale of investment contracts, violating securities law.

However, lawyers for Terraform Labs said the Ripple ruling confirms the “legal insufficiency” of the agency’s argument that Terraform’s stablecoin and other cryptocurrencies were financial securities, according to documents filed July 18 asking the court to dismiss the SEC’s case against Terraform.

The SEC charged Singapore-based Terraform and its South Korean founder Kwon in February for a “multi-billion dollar crypto asset securities fraud” involving the Terra stablecoin and Luna cryptocurrency, which both collapsed and erased billions of dollars in value.

South Korean prosecutors issued an arrest warrant for Kwon last September, also on the allegation he offered unregistered investment contract securities via Terra-Luna. He was also charged with other offences, including fraud. His lawyers have rejected the charges.

Chainlink’s LINK traded flat following a 15% rise on Thursday – buoyed by the introduction of its CCIP protocol earlier this week. MKR, the governance token of lending platform MakerDAO, defied the broader market's price action, surging 11% in a day as investors welcomed the activation of a token buyback program.

New crypto oversight bill
Some of the selling pressure may have also arisen as U.S. House Republicans introduced a new digital assets oversight bill on Thursday that aims to establish a regulatory framework to protect investors in the crypto sector.

Analysts said parts of the revised bill exclude from the definition of ""digital assets"" a range of traditional securities such as stocks, bonds, ""transferable share[s],"" ""certificate[s] of interest or participation in any profit-sharing agreement,"" and so on.

“All they have to do is argue that a token is a ""transferable share"" ""a profit interest"" etc,” Gabriel Shapiro, general counsel at crypto fund Delphi Digital, tweeted. “XRP and such will be fine but DeFi can still be persecuted at will... actually the regulators will have expanded authority to do so.”

Meanwhile, the drop in prices caused over $66 million in liquidations in the past 24 hours, data from the analytics tool Coinglass shows. Slightly over 70% of these liquidations were on longs positions, or from traders betting on higher prices.

Liquidations occur when traders borrow funds from exchanges to bet on crypto prices using a relatively smaller initial capital, one that is forfeited when prices reach a predetermined liquidation level.",Ripple

Ripple Labs: More turbulence ahead?
Forkast 500 NFT Index: Entering a historically slow period
Hong Kong banks: Going back and forth
From the Editor’s Desk

Dear Reader,

The crypto community can be forgiven for feeling a little schadenfreude in recent days after we all watched a judge in the Southern District of New York stick it to the Securities and Exchange Commission in its case against Ripple Labs.


But, as many in the digital asset industry quickly began to realize when details of the verdict emerged, it was a little premature to pop the champagne, and the “payback time” mood was short-lived.

True, the SEC appears to have suffered a setback in its crusade to regulate (some might say crush) crypto by enforcement, and the Ripple-linked token XRP almost doubled in value on the news, with trading volumes briefly topping those of all other cryptocurrencies, but the victory was only partial. More importantly, it failed to provide the eureka moment of unambiguous regulatory clarity that the crypto industry and many other constituencies had hoped for.

The court’s ruling that XRP isn’t a security when it’s sold on exchanges and via algorithms, but that it is when it’s sold to institutional buyers, is an unhappy compromise that, while potentially providing relief to the likes of Cardano and Solana, also targeted by the SEC, remains underwhelming.

Its most egregious failure is that it leaves the door open for further legal interpretations. That could mean more muddying of the already turbid legal waters. It could also mean an appeal of the court’s decision by the SEC when the regulator has finished licking its wounds.

Ripple’s win can therefore be described as limited, and it begs the question of why we’re not seeing such unproductive – and indeed destructive – legal wars of attrition in other jurisdictions.

Could it be because many – notably the European Union – have come up with workable regulatory frameworks for the industry rather than blowing hot and cold on it as U.S. politicians have done while the SEC fills the policy vacuum with lawsuits?

When it comes to regulation, the U.S. has often been at the forefront of innovation, and its frameworks of rules and norms have been emulated the world over. Given that, and the fact that crypto is such an intensely innovative phenomenon, we can and should expect better.

1. Think twice
Ripple SEC
Despite the recent ruling, Ripple Labs’ court battle against the SEC may not be over. Image: SEC/Canva
In a Tuesday letter to SEC Chair Gary Gensler, a U.S. lawmaker urged the financial regulator to “reassess its regulatory assault on crypto assets” after the verdict on the Ripple-SEC case last week.

“In a landmark legal opinion, Judge Torres resoundingly rejected the regulatory overreach of the SEC, which has been indiscriminately declaring all crypto assets, except Bitcoin, to be securities,” said Representative Ritchie Torres of New York in the letter posted on Twitter, adding that “(crypto) regulation by enforcement had a dreadful day in court.”

Torres commented after U.S. District Court Judge Analisa Torres ruled on July 13 that Ripple Labs’ programmatic sales of its XRP cryptocurrency did not qualify as financial securities, marking a partial victory for Ripple in its almost three-year lawsuit against SEC, which accused the former of conducting unregistered securities offering. However, the summary judgment also ruled that Ripple’s direct sales of XRP to institutional clients violated the securities law.

At a Monday event of the National Press Club in Washington, D.C., Gensler said he was “disappointed” with the court’s ruling regarding the retail investors, and his agency was still assessing the judge’s opinion.

Boosted by the court ruling, the XRP price has surged over 68% since July 13 and rose past US$0.70 for the first time since April 2022, according to data from CoinMarketCap. The token traded at US$0.81 at press time.

“The ruling is a big win for the industry overall, offering clarity to the status of digital assets,” Jeff Mei, chief operating officer of crypto exchange BTSE, said in an emailed comment on July 14. “Although the ruling decision was based on the specific details of the Ripple case, the results will definitely support other firms who are in legal battles with the SEC regarding the classification of their products in the U.S.”

Despite the general optimism in the crypto industry, some advised caution as regulatory uncertainty persisted. “There will be further court proceedings … It is also not yet known if the SEC will appeal the ruling,” Caroline Bowler, chief executive officer of Australia-based crypto exchange BTC Markets, told Forkast in an email. “Potential for more insecurity ahead for Ripple.”

Forkast.Insights | What does it mean?

In a landmark court decision with implications for the global cryptocurrency industry, the verdict concerning the status of XRP has been met with both clarity and confusion by stakeholders.

For retail investors of XRP who participated in the secondary sales of the digital currency, such as those that acquired it through crypto exchanges, this legal outcome brought much-needed clarity. CoinMarketCap data indicates a noteworthy surge in the asset’s value to US$0.82, a peak not seen since pre-Terra-Luna in April 2022, which was observed shortly following the court’s decision.

The potential future ramifications of this ruling for the classification of cryptocurrencies as securities in the U.S. cannot be overstated. Lawsuits recently lodged by the SEC against Binance and Coinbase underscored this, with the agency deeming at least 12 additional cryptocurrencies, including popular coins like Cardano’s ADA and Solana’s SOL, as securities. Should the recent ruling concerning secondary XRP sales extend to these cryptocurrencies, investors may find further cause for celebration. Some leading exchanges in the U.S. that delisted XRP have already started to relist the cryptocurrency.

Nevertheless, a cautious approach remains warranted. While some commentators have hastened to label the recent XRP ruling as a significant triumph for cryptocurrency investors, only a fraction of XRP transactions since 2017, less than 1% as court documents suggest, qualify as programmatic sales.

Notably, the court concluded that Ripple’s direct XRP sales to professional investors infringed U.S. securities laws. Despite the ruling being largely perceived as a victory for the sector, safety might only extend to 1% of XRP holders.

This leaves Ripple Labs and its executives, including Brad Garlinghouse and Chris Larsen, potentially entangled in continued legal complexities.

2. Who turned down the volume?
Forkast 500 NFT data July 19
The indexes are proxy measures of the performance of the global NFT market. They are managed by CryptoSlam, a sister company of Forkast.News under the Forkast Labs umbrella.
The non-fungible tokens market fell to another new low this week, even after positive news from across the blockchain industry following a U.S. judge’s ruling that XRP was not a security. Global NFT volumes fell to a seven-month low, with the Forkast 500 NFT Index slipping 0.64% to 2,689.33, reflecting the slow trading week.

Blockchain sales volume shows Ethereum increasing 6.63%, Polygon rising 11.05%, and ImmutableX gaining 5.8%, while Bitcoin declined 54.96% and Solana lost 21.25%.

Global NFT sales volume shrank to a 39-week low, the lowest since October 10-16, 2022.

NFT weekly trade profits strengthened 66.5%, while average sales prices declined 5.41%.

Daily Ethereum and Solana transactions on July 16 neared a two-year low, with 13,992 total transactions on Ethereum, the lowest since the blockchain’s 13,560 transactions on July 24, 2021. Solana had 10,475 transactions, its lowest since 8,462 transactions on Sept. 19, 2021.

The Solana and Cardano Composites gained 4.63% and 5.38%, respectively, boosted by the increase in their platform’s token, $SOL (+18.9%) and $ADA (+8.11%).

The Polygon Composite declined 5.37%, with the number of unique sellers falling 50% and total transactions decreasing 12.02%.

Forkast.Insights | What does it mean?

This week, the market slowed significantly on Sunday when Ethereum and Solana, the number one and three-ranked blockchains by sales volume, fell to nearly a two-year low in transactions. Global sales also declined to a 39-week low, showing investors have throttled back from trading. And who can blame them? Trade profits are still largely negative with US$8.2 million of losses for the week ending July 16, and new mints still are failing to offer innovation for collectors.

On any given day this week, CryptoSlam’s collections ranking perfectly shows the change in the market, with the top 10 leaderboard reflecting collections that struggle to reach US$500,000 in sales in a 24-hour period. Simply put, traders have stepped on the brakes as they slow down their trading practices and have moved onto securing grails, trading crypto, or taking a break entirely.

Prices of collections like Bored Ape Yacht Club, CryptoPunks, and Azuki continue to hover around two-year laws, but they’re full of NFTs that many consider grails. These low prices attract collectors who have been waiting to enter the exclusive communities and investors who still see great financial opportunities in these collections. Noteworthy sales this week include BAYC #1734 (US$1.2 million), CryptoPunks #8531 (US$1 million), CryptoPunks #5402 (US$340,000), CryptoPunks #512 (US$311,000), and around two dozen other CryptoPunks that sold for over US$100,000.

NFTs at the macro level show that the base of collectors in the NFT ecosystem has clearly grown over the years, even if they’re not as active now. Total transactions and supply in 2023 across blockchains dwarf what we have witnessed in years past. In fact, the increase in NFT supply, now up to some 302 million NFTs, shows the exponential growth that the blockchain collectibles ecosystem has witnessed since 2021, when fewer than 10 million NFTs existed. Total transactions in 2023 tell the same story, with over 44 million transactions just over halfway this year compared to 40 million last year, and 12.4 million in 2021.

With the NFT market heading into the historically slow August-December with little momentum behind it, NFTs seems to be falling headfirst into one of its first significant tests of traders’ conviction. This second-half stretch typically finds US collectors all but giving some NFTs for free as they look to harvest losses on their taxes. Will traders be spooked by the sale of grails at floor prices, along with volume and sales that may look closer to the period before NFTs reached the masses?

In some positive news to end this week, Yuga Labs announced that Ape Fest 2023 will take place on Nov. 3-5 in Hong Kong. With China potentially primed to enter the NFT market in a big way, traders are hoping the can’t-miss NFT party will help close out the year with NFT fireworks. Some even speculate that Yuga Labs may launch its Othereside metaverse to make this a worldwide party that bridges the physical and digital worlds. If they pull this off, the era of the metaverse may finally be upon us and with it, a potential new NFT boom.

3. Holding back
Hong Kong cryptocurrency
Hong Kong banks turning away crypto companies could hinder the city’s ambitions. Image: Canva
At least two global banks operating in Hong Kong have “ruled out any activity directly linked to crypto trading,” while others hesitate to open accounts for customers of crypto exchanges, the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) reported on Monday, citing anonymous sources, without naming the two banks.

The banks’ reluctance to service crypto-related companies can be attributed to the money laundering risks in cryptocurrencies and a lack of risk-management frameworks in the crypto industry, according to the WSJ report.

Local banks rejecting crypto companies could be an obstacle to Hong Kong’s economic ambition. Hong Kong aims to be a hub for the Web3 industry and in June, began its new licensing regime for virtual asset service providers.

Hong Kong’s new licensing rules that require a crypto exchange to establish one or more segregated accounts with a financial institution, together with Hong Kong banks’ cautious attitudes, is an issue for crypto companies seeking to expand in the city.

The banking issue has raised concerns among local regulators. In June, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, the city’s central bank, reportedly pressed major lenders, including HSBC, Standard Chartered and Bank of China, to service local crypto exchanges, after issuing letters and commentaries to advise local banks not to reject crypto firms’ request to open accounts because of the industry.

But not all lenders in Hong Kong are rejecting crypto companies. The WSJ report said an unnamed large global bank had changed its position and was considering opening basic accounts for crypto exchanges applying for licenses in Hong Kong, citing anonymous sources. Meanwhile, local banks such as ZA Bank and the Hong Kong branch of China’s Bank of Communications started servicing crypto firms earlier this year.

Forkast.Insights | What does it mean?

Not even two months following the day that Hong Kong’s cryptocurrency regulations came into effect, it seems that some people are already spoiling the party that many – perhaps especially the city’s government, which drafted them – had been eagerly anticipating.

The Journal’s report that two or more unnamed global banks in Hong Kong have eschewed engaging with anything linked to crypto trading inevitably invites speculation as to which lenders these might be.

The fact that HSBC, one of the city’s highest-profile banks, saw fit to beef up restrictions on its UK retail customers’ access to crypto assets earlier this year may suggest to some that it’s one of them. But given the limited information currently available, speculation would be imprudent.

More important than any witch hunt for names is the fact that – at least reportedly – big banks appear to be putting the brakes on the Hong Kong Monetary Authority’s ambitious plans to turn the city into a crypto hub. And, moreover, the fact that they appear to be doing so despite exhortations by the de facto central bank to service the industry it is so keen to nurture.

It’s apposite to recall that something similar occurred in India in 2020, when the country’s Supreme Court overturned a ban on banks’ handling of crypto-related transactions imposed by the Reserve Bank of India. Lenders listened more to the central bank than they did to the court, and proceeded to continue refusing crypto-linked business.

The specifics of the two cases differ, admittedly, but could we be seeing another case of banks simply not doing what they’re told?

A curious aspect of what’s happening in Hong Kong is the fact that Chinese state banks – once considered some of the least likely lenders in the world to touch anything with even a whiff of crypto, thanks to Beijing’s blanket ban on it – appear to have warmed to the idea of servicing crypto clients in the city. The extent to which they offer crypto businesses a way of going about their affairs in Hong Kong will be something to watch.

And given Hong Kong authorities’ increased willingness to assert their agenda following their Beijing-instigated assault on the local legal and political systems, the press and more during the past four years, we could even see other lenders receiving potentially more persuasive official encouragement to follow the state banks’ lead if they don’t toe the line.

But in the meantime, uncertainty complicates prospects for crypto enterprises trying to do business in a city where operating licenses depend on the ability to open accounts that banks are reluctant to make available.

As developers and entrepreneurs – like their counterparts in India a few years ago – weigh their options and consider more supportive financial ecosystems in which to operate, Hong Kong’s path to becoming a crypto hub seems more challenging than it ought to be.

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/xrp-moving-above-cloud-resistance-053853726.html,XRP Moving Above 'Cloud' Resistance Is Bullish Precedent for Bitcoin: Analyst,"Payments-focused XRP has set a bullish precedent for market leader bitcoin (BTC) with a move above key price resistance that has opened doors for a sustained rally.

XRP surged nearly 60% last week, registering its best performance since August 2021. The rally saw prices move convincingly above a technical analysis indicator called ""Ichimoku cloud"" on the weekly chart, confirming a bullish breakout.


Bitcoin (BTC) is yet to achieve that feat.

""We view [XRP's] cloud breakout as a good example for bitcoin,"" founder and managing partner at Fairlead Strategies said in a note to clients.

The Ichimoku Cloud, a technical analysis indicator created by Japanese journalist Goichi Hosoda in the late 1960s, is widely used by traders and analysts to identify support and resistance levels and gauge trend changes. The indicator comprises five lines based on the price's moving averages: Leading Span A, Leading Span B, Conversion Line or Tenkan-Sen (T), Base Line or Kijun-Sen (K) and a lagging closing price line. The spread between the Leading Span A and the leading Span B represents the cloud.

Crossovers above or below the cloud are widely taken to represent bullish or bearish trend change.


XRP has established a foothold above the Ichimoku cloud, while bitcoin remains locked in a narrow range below the cloud resistance (upper end).The token's breakout follows a year-long consolidation or basing pattern and suggests more gains ahead.

""The move is meaningful on the chart because it resolves a year-long basing process higher. Intermediate-term momentum is positive and there are (surprisingly) no signs of upside exhaustion, supporting upside follow-through, with next resistance near $0.92,"" Stockton noted.

A similar bullish outlook awaits bitcoin on the higher side of the Ichimoku cloud, with the next resistance level at $31,900.

Ether inched up 0.57% during afternoon trading in Asia to US$1,909, struggling to stay above the US$1,900 support level.

The XRP token was the day’s biggest gainer, rising 5.52% to US$0.7849. The coin is up 65.3% on the weekly chart, as traders remain upbeat after the ruling that the sale of XRP did not constitute a security.

“This victory marked a significant milestone as the first-ever win for a cryptocurrency company in a case brought by the SEC,” Simon Schaber, the chief commercial officer of Spool DAO, told Forkast.

“Like the rest of this industry, the SEC is in new territory and is therefore creating new guidance and proposing new laws as it goes, which is why we’re unlikely to see the end of this by 2024.”

Market sentiment appeared to lack conviction, despite positive news like the SEC accepting a second spot Bitcoin ETF application for review, from asset management giant Valkyrie.

The SEC agreed the same for the application by BlackRock on July 13, which along with several other Bitcoin ETF applications set off a bullish run in crypto for the past month. BlackRock is the world’s largest asset manager with US$9.4 trillion in assets. Tennessee-based Valkyrie had more than US$1 billion in assets under management in 2022.

The Opepen craze also subsided, as the collection’s 24-hour sales fell 59.02% to US$324,841.

“We’re on pace for another yearly low for total global transactions today, and in general, sales are pretty unremarkable across blockchains,” said Yehudah Petscher, NFT Strategist at Forkast Labs, the parent company of Forkast.News.

“The top collections are struggling to even reach US$500,000 in daily secondary sales, which is unusual to see. The index reflects a flat market.”

All the Forkast Labs NFT indexes were in the red, with the Forkast POL NFT Composite sustaining the biggest daily loss of 1.76%.

“The Ripple vs. SEC lawsuit did not generate a broader lasting rally in crypto,” David Lawant, head of research at institutional crypto exchange FalconX.

After a two-year legal battle instigated by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, a judge ruled that XRP is an unregistered security when sold to institutional buyers but isn’t when it’s bought by anyone else.

This is an excerpt from The Node newsletter, a daily roundup of the most pivotal crypto news on CoinDesk and beyond. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.


In 2020 the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed a lawsuit against Ripple, its CEO Brad Garlinghouse and co-founder Chris Larsen, alleging failure to register its token XRP as a security before selling around $1.3 billion worth. What followed was years of Twitter spats and incremental legal advancements as Ripple attempted to argue how fundamentally incorrect it is to call XRP a security.

Never mind that there is a company in Ripple behind XRP, which means that one could reasonably conclude that XRP purchasers would expect to profit from the managerial or entrepreneurial efforts of the token issuers (i.e. the basic definition of a security in question). No. XRP is called a cryptocurrency and its supporters argue it cannot possibly be a security.

With last week’s news, XRP unsurprisingly rallied. Its token price nearly doubled and trading volumes exploded by an eye-watering 1,351%.

But Thursday’s news has done basically nothing to make clear where crypto will stand in the eyes of U.S. law. We know where the SEC stands – everything is a security except Bitcoin and maybe Ethereum – but the SEC isn’t the end all be all. Now we’re in this weird world where we have a crypto asset that is an unregistered security sometimes. Sure, there’s a difference between retail and institutional buyers here since retail did not (and is not) buying XRP directly from Ripple so there cannot be an investment contract between retail investors and Ripple.

Still, I submit that this makes no sense. It’s like saying someone who buys a house as an investment is buying real estate, but a person who buys a house to live in is not buying real estate. It’s nonsense. Either XRP is a security, or it is not. These should be mutually exclusive.

So, no, JMP Securities, this is not a milestone win for the crypto industry. I know you published a research note that stated this ruling “provides legal clarity and defense around what does and does not constitute a security, and that overall outcome is in favor of what many in the industry had been arguing” but that’s not what was provided here at all.

Video Transcript
- In a shock ruling last week, Judge Analisa Torres found Ripple Labs had not violated SEC rules by selling its XRP token on public exchanges. The decision throws a lot of US crypto token regulation into disarray as investors try to understand how future cases might be settled. A Ripple Labs CEO came out saying that the SEC has, quote, ""sowed confusion in the market and really been a bully, going after weak players who couldn't mount proper defenses.""

We're joined now by Devin Ryan, director of financial technology research at JMP Securities, a citizen's company. So let me just ask you. At first blush, this seems like a huge win for Ripple customers, at least people who own the tokens. I dive into the ruling. And it looks like sales on the secondary market are a little bit cloudy. There just maybe highlight for some of the people in the audience here what the various facets of this ruling mean.

DEVIN RYAN: Hey, good morning, Jared. I think the biggest thing that we took away from the ruling is really around XRP, the token. And our understanding from reading the summary judgment was that the token itself is not the security, which I think has very important read through to the rest of the industry. But then the other piece of it is that depending on how the token is sold, that will deem whether it's a security not.

So on one hand, the institutional sales to institutions were deemed as securities transactions. And that piece of the case is going to go to trial. And then the retail transactions and the trading on exchanges, my interpretation is that it is not deemed a securities transaction.

So if you think about the implication for firms like Coinbase or others in the industry that run exchanges, I think this is a very good outcome. But this is just one piece of the puzzle. You know, this doesn't end other regulatory actions that are happening concurrent to the Ripple case. And so we'll have to continue to follow from here, but definitely a win, as you mentioned.

- Yeah. Well, let me ask you about other court cases that are pending right now. There's been a huge crackdown on crypto in general. Gary Gensler, head of the chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission, is on record saying that everything, except Bitcoin, may be a security that needs to be registered. Well, that's a pretty blanket statement right there. How does this ruling affect or maybe put some shade on those statements by Chair Gensler?

DEVIN RYAN: Yeah. Well, I think what the industry is looking for is clarity here. And there's been a lack of clarity. And so there's statements made by regulators. But then there's actions that seem to go against some of those statements.

So what we just learned, at least in one court, is that the view is that certain digital tokens, including XRP, are not inherently securities. And so that gives at least clarity for now around that one topic. But you know, I think that will continue to be challenged.

Where I think the industry here is going is really that to the point of we need there to be legislation. There needs to be action out of DC. And there is some progress on that front. And I think that this ruling could help accelerate that.

And so that's one point that I think is positive and something that people are kind of taking out of this ruling that this may be an accelerant to getting more done in DC on the topic and really defining the rules of the road. Because that's really what the industry has been lacking. And so therefore, you know, this ruling is a positive, but we still don't have clear rules of the road. And that still needs to come here.

- And you mentioned legislative action. That would probably be the clearest because then you have the intent of the representatives in Congress who represent the American people making the case, instead of trying to figure-- reinterpret decades-old securities laws. Is there a chance that we see any kind of incremental regulation on the crypto front from Congress? Or do we have to wait for the SEC and these other agencies that have been very slow to give guidance to finally give that guidance?

DEVIN RYAN: Yeah. I think that's the hope that Congress is already looking at certain legislation. And there's been some that have been progressing. And so I think the hope here is that we get action on that over the next year or so. And some of that is potentially going to accelerate just on the heels of this ruling, which adds kind of more of a legal framework from the courts around how they're thinking about it.

Again, it's one court, one ruling, but I think kind of it pushes the industry forward in that direction. And that's also-- if you take a step back and you look at how a lot of these stocks or related stocks have reacted and been reacting, it's been very favorable because it's essentially adding, I think, the probability more in their favor. And so that's been something that just even over the past week, you've seen some pretty significant moves.

And so there's still a lot of work to be done for the industry. There's still a lack of clarity. This one ruling in and of itself does not create precedent. But you need to start somewhere. And I think this is definitely something that's positive in the industry is going to use this momentum to try to get, I think, more action in DC, which is really, again, what's going to create the real definition and the rules of the road for the industry.

- Well, let me ask you then. We have just under a minute to go. Anything we haven't covered here, anything that you'd like to highlight that think could drive either a tailwinds or headwinds for these crypto, tokens, stocks, anything in there?

DEVIN RYAN: Yeah. I think one of the biggest things is institutional adoption. I know that's something that people have been talking about for years. But we really haven't seen it in kind of a traditional way. And the reason being is because institutions acting as fiduciaries for their customers really need to have clarity around regulation.

And so this is a positive step, but this does not bring full clarity. And so I would say that we've been in an environment where capital has been constrained. And because of the uncertainty, institutions have not been in the space.

To the extent we get more positive developments just like we saw last week, that could really be the catalyst to drive what I would say real capital into this industry. And that's going to do a couple of things. It's going to accelerate innovation in the industry. And it's also going to accelerate adoption I think both on the institutional side, but it'll also drive more retail folks into the space and understanding what the different types of innovations are in blockchain.

So to me, that's really what we're looking for a little bit more clarity. This is a positive step. But a progression here so that institutions can really come in and bring capital with them into the space. And I think that's really what's lacking, but I do think that that's coming here because this space is not going away.

There's so much money that's already in the space it's not going away. So we just need to get better rules of the road. And I think that's what's coming next.

- I agree there. After two years of a crypto winter, obviously, attention on the space is a little bit down. But you have to think that if it's still around and given the billions of dollars of prior investment, that it's here to stay here, at least for a little while.

XRP continued its rally after XRP issuer Ripple’s favorable ruling last week in its lawsuit with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Investors were also upbeat after the SEC accepted BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) applications for review.

Bitcoin, Ether slip but remain above key levels, XRP leads gains
Bitcoin was little changed during the Asia trading day, holding at US$30,321 as of 4:30 p.m. in Hong Kong.

Ether inched down 0.15% during afternoon trading in Asia, to change hands at US$1,931, holding above US$1,900 since Thursday.

The XRP token was the day’s biggest gainer, rising 4.22% to US$0.7483. The token rallied 59.67% on the week after U.S. District Court Judge Analisa Torres ruled Thursday that Ripple Labs’ programmatic sales of its XRP cryptocurrency did not qualify as financial securities.

Adding to positive investor sentiment, the SEC has accepted asset manager BlackRock’s application for a spot Bitcoin ETF for review. This signals the SEC’s intent to seriously consider the ETF application.

“An approved ETF could be the catalyst that provides an efficient and regulated way for institutional investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin. Such approval could potentially bring significant inflows of institutional capital into the market, increasing liquidity and driving up prices,” Lucas Kiely, the chief investment officer of digital asset platform Yield App, told Forkast.

“It would signal a maturing and mainstream acceptance of Bitcoin, instilling confidence in both retail and institutional investors. It would remove some of the perceived barriers to entry, making it easier for individuals and institutions to participate in the market.”

The total crypto market capitalization over the past 24 hours rose 0.10% to US$1.21 trillion and market volume increased 3.97% to US$25.93 billion, according to CoinMarketCap data.

Bitcoin NFT sales rise, Ethereum NFT sales lose momentum
The Forkast 500 NFT index rose 0.25% to 2,729.89 points in the 24 hours to 4:30 p.m. in Hong Kong but fell 0.48% during the week.

Bitcoin’s 24-hour non-fungible token sales increased 73.17% to US$1.59 million, as sales for Uncategorized Ordinals rallied 99.29% to US$627,110.

Ethereum’s 24-hour NFT sales fell 13.67% to US$11.6 million, as sales for the largest Ethereum-native NFT collection, the Bored Ape Yacht Club, rose 1.05% to US$706,564. Last Friday, Yuga Labs, the company behind The Bored Ape Yacht Club NFT collection, announced that it will hold ApeFest, an event to celebrate the firm’s NFT collections, in Hong Kong, at the beginning of November.

On Ethereum, sales for the Captainz collection also rose 19.36% to US$548,312.

“NFTs continue to ride the wave of positive news and positive prices in crypto. However, we’re not seeing any noteworthy gains in projects and instead, most of the big names are still down for the past seven days,” said Yehudah Petscher, NFT Strategist at Forkast Labs, the parent company of Forkast.News.

“Traders are hurting for liquidity and when we see volume it’s often paired with decreasing prices.”

Among the Forkast Labs NFT indexes, the Forkast ETH NFT Composite was the only one in the red, falling 0.13% to 928.58 points.

Asian equities, U.S. stock futures fall

Major Asian equities weakened as of 4:30 p.m. in Hong Kong, with Japan’s Nikkei 225, the Shenzhen Component Index and Shanghai Composite all posting declines.

Hong Kong markets halted trading in both securities and derivatives markets on Monday, amid a warning over Typhoon Talim. While the storm has not caused any major damage, authorities warned that it could lead to flooding.

Investor sentiment turned negative after data showed that China’s economy grew 6.3% in the second quarter, below expected expansion of 7.3%. Retail sales also missed preliminary forecasts. Investors are hoping for more stimulus measures from Beijing to bolster the mainland’s post-pandemic recovery.

U.S. stock futures also fell during Monday afternoon trading in Hong Kong, with the S&P 500 futures index, the tech-heavy Nasdaq-100 futures and the Dow Jones Industrial Average futures all weakening.

This week, investors are anticipating earnings reports from major banks like Bank of America, Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs. Companies like Tesla, Netflix and United Airlines are also releasing their earnings reports.

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/could-ripple-ruling-spell-end-195021402.html,Could the Ripple Ruling Spell the End of Regulation by Enforcement?,"The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) recently had a no-good, very bad day because of a district judge’s ruling in the SEC’s action against Ripple’s XRP token. Despite issuing a statement filled with bravado and the kind of detachment from reality that might make even Donald Trump think twice before pressing send, the SEC likely knows how serious of a rebuke its overall approach to crypto received in a federal court. If the ruling holds, we may be witnessing the beginning of the end of SEC Chair Gensler’s regulation-by-enforcement approach to crypto assets, and the end will be messy for those who oppose crypto.

Who could have seen that coming? It was entirely predictable to many, except for a tiny cauldron of activists in Washington, D.C. who adopted the view that “all tokens are securities” with a religious fervor. While the SEC will most assuredly appeal the district court’s decision, action in the courts will take months and are merely a sideshow to a larger reality, namely, the district court’s ruling. And what great timing as the policy debate in Congress is advancing their legislation to put a regulatory framework around crypto assets.


John Rizzo is senior vice president for public affairs at Clyde Group and a former spokesperson for the U.S. Department of the Treasury.

To understand why the policy debate has changed and its import on what rules tokens will be required to abide by, one must consider the long, winding road that crypto policy has traveled.

The desire to bring crypto assets into a regulatory perimeter has long been supported by many Republicans and Democrats in Washington. The thinking, which I observed when I served as a senior spokesperson at the U.S. Department of the Treasury and before that as a senior aide on Capitol Hill, was that crypto assets – love them or hate them – were here to stay and required regulatory frameworks that would mitigate risks, such as fraud perpetrated against consumers, illicit finance and destabilizing runs.

The realist strategy of regulating rather than attempting to ban crypto ran headlong into a desire by some in D.C. to achieve a policy outcome of eradicating crypto. These forces sought to throw sand in the gears of any legislation bringing a comprehensive crypto regulatory framework into law by asserting that crypto assets were merely securities offered by market participants who refused to comply with the law. The assertion that “most crypto tokens are securities” laid the groundwork for the SEC to achieve the anti-crypto crowd’s policy aims through regulatory means.

As of early 2023, the SEC’s regulation by enforcement spree remained untouched by the courts. Those who favored stifling crypto in America could persuasively argue to congressional Democrats, who are needed for any bipartisan crypto deal, that legislation was unnecessary and potentially harmful.

Tables turned
Ironically, with the district court’s ruling ramming a hole through the SEC and the anti-crypto crowd’s strategy, crypto opposers may be forced to accept a legislative agreement more permissive to crypto assets than would have been enacted during the previous Congress, one which Democrats controlled.

Instead of a regulatory framework for crypto assets designed and passed by a Democratic Congress and implemented by a Democratic administration, Democrats may be forced to accept an agreement drafted by congressional Republicans on the House Financial Services Committee. With the SEC and anti-crypto Democrats deprived of the argument that their legal cases were sound, there’s nothing to stop an acceleration of efforts to cinch a bipartisan agreement on a regulatory framework for crypto assets.

The SEC and those who support its approach are likely concerned that this no-good, very bad day becomes no-good, very bad days. A string of court losses with similar legal reasoning as yesterday’s ruling in the Ripple case would weaken anti-crypto Democrats' negotiating hand further. One takes this risk when placing all their betting chips on a novel legal strategy. When you lose, you lose significantly, and the other side of the debate understands that your negotiating leverage worsens by the day.

Far from achieving the end of crypto in America, the SEC’s attempt to cripple crypto in America may lead to a bipartisan regulatory framework that engrains crypto more deeply into the economy than once thought possible – a bad day for those who banked on a strategy of killing crypto assets in America, indeed.",Ripple

Berenberg Capital Markets Senior Equity Research Analyst Mark Palmer says ""it looks very much like the SEC is going to appeal this ruling to the Second Circuit court of appeals. It may ultimately end up at the Supreme Court, which is our expectation."" Palmer and Delta Blockchain Fund General Partner Kavita Gupta joined Yahoo Finance Live to discuss the case.

Video Transcript
- Cryptocurrencies have been in the spotlight of the SEC and Congress for a lack of regulation and for how to best protect investors. Judge Annalisa Torres of the US District Court of the Southern District of New York has been presiding over one such case, whether Ripple's XRP token can be classified as a security. On Thursday, Judge Torres provided her nuanced view, saying that the XRP token can be regarded as a security for institutional sales after it passed the Howey test several times. However, the court ruled that XRP cannot be a security when it's being sold to the broad public.

So what could this mean for the future of crypto regulation? We're joined now by Berenberg Capital Markets senior equity research analyst Mark Palmer and Delta Blockchain fund general partner Kavita Gupta to discuss more. Great to have you both here with us today. Mark, you're here in studio with us. You know, just your initial reaction even as you heard this particular case ruling, or at least the opinion of the court come down from the judge.

MARK PALMER: Well, I view it as a split decision. There definitely were some aspects of this that were favorable for Ripple, but at the same time, there were certain aspects that were not favorable for Ripple, including the fact that it was found to be guilty of engaging in illegal securities transactions with institutional investors to the tune of several hundred million dollars.

But the main takeaway as it pertains to the broader crypto space and to Coinbase and the like in our view is that, number one, the judge did rule that the Howey test is applicable and should be used to determine whether cryptocurrencies are securities, and then things got a bit more nuanced in terms of the application of that, which we think her interpretation may be a little bit outside of the judicial mainstream.

And at the same time, she stated that XRP could be viewed as being part of a securities transaction once it's actually used. The fact that XRP itself is not a crypto token, is a security, that doesn't really mean much if, at the same time, the trading of that crypto token is interpreted to be a securities transaction. So if you're running a secondary market or a crypto exchange that facilitates transactions that are in the secondary market, you know, it appears that she's not addressing that, and there's specifically a footnote in which he says that she does not address secondary market transactions.

JULIE HYMAN: Yeah, I mean, there was-- Kavita, there was a lot of celebration on crypto Twitter yesterday it felt like that, oh, this is a blow to the FCC, this is a victory for crypto, and as Mark explains, it definitely feels more nuanced than that. So what do you think is the sort of reading in the community that should be as a result of this ruling?

KAVITA GUPTA: So I was-- truly the way we look at it from the crypto community, right? So far for the longest time there has not been any rules. There has not been any direction. So the positive side of yesterday's hearing is that if it is getting progmatic sales, which is through exchanges, which is through centralized or decentralized exchanges, it's not a security violation of the same token, but at the same time, as Mark mentioned, doing it for institutional sales mostly for speculative value is.

The way the crypto industry has been thinking is so the token itself cannot be a security and a not security at the same time. That means there is definitely a step ahead about how do you really place it in the market and how does the sales around it happen. So if it is really decentralized, then the same token is not security, and I think that's a big win at least to have a clarity or towards the direction of a clarity that the same token can not be-- go through-- cannot be a security or have to go through a Howey test, and I think that's a very, very positive sign.

- You know, even after having so many conversations and covering this space for a while, for a lot of end consumers it can get a little bit muddled or confusing over time too. So how even in these processes of trying to ensure that there's a safe way forward regulatory-wise and framework-wise for crypto and for blockchain more broadly, that there's still transparency that's at the core of this for the safety around how people can transact with or trade crypto at the end of the day, Kavita?

KAVITA GUPTA: I completely agree with you. And honestly speaking, that has been one of the biggest frustration for the crypto community too. What deemed decentralized or centralized from the perspective of SEC, and I want to underline again, like, we are talking about SEC who did, in a way, sign off to the IP of the Coinbase, came back, listed some random companies or random tokens without giving explanation that these 12 and these 13 tokens are security, and now we are going back to the direction, what really makes them security and not the rest, and is the security is actually not even a token? Is the security is the way or the means the retail customer gets to be part of it or as a user or a speculative value?

And I think maybe one of the biggest things for the crypto community, including myself as an investor in the space for since 2013, one of the biggest eye-opening for me is, is the direction not going to be about Howey test or is it about going to be the tokens created or centralized, decentralized, but the way it is placed outside for retail customers for their security? If that is the case, then it may not be even-- then the regulations has to be expanded and the standard digital asset regulations may not be applicable to it. So maybe everything that crypto industry has been saying, that we need extended or a new format or regulations around it is a very legible way and then ask.

JULIE HYMAN: Let's bring it back to specific reaction that we saw in the market, and I want to bring it to Coinbase in particular, which rose yesterday and it's rising again today, Mark. Should it be? Is this-- I mean, is the feedthrough positive?

MARK PALMER: I would question the extent to which Coinbase has rallied in the period after this ruling was issued simply because I don't see this as being a clear win for Coinbase. One of the things that the SEC alleges in its lawsuit against Coinbase is that it has been operating illegally a securities exchange in which there are significant conflicts, because the company is simultaneously running an exchange, a broker dealer, and a clearinghouse, which in the eyes of the SEC is rife with conflict and ultimately may only be remedied through a breakup of those functions.

But I think that beyond that, the fact that the judge ruled on primary transactions involving Ripple in which Ripple was distributing its XRP token through primary transactions, not secondary transactions, is a very important distinction here, because the judge effectively punted on the question of secondary transactions, and even within that context, she had a very interesting take on protection of institutions on the one hand and no investor protections for retail investors on the other, which is odd simply because securities laws were put in place specifically for the protection of individual investors.

So with all of that said, it looks very much like the SEC is going to appeal this ruling to the Second Circuit Court of Appeals. It may ultimately end up with the Supreme Court, which is our expectation. So this is round one, and it's inconclusive.

- How does this further impact some of the offerings that Coin has wanted to put out too of its either own currency or for the number of currencies that are listed through Coinbase at this point?

MARK PALMER: Well, again, XRP was not one of the tokens that was identified by the SEC as an illegally traded security, i.e. a crypto token that was a security on Coinbase platform. With all of those others it remains a question, and yes, what the market is doing right now is reading through from the Ripple ruling to all of those other securities and suggesting that they are now Scot free.

We think that if you look at the Howey test specifically, one of the points there is that there is an expectation of profit arising from the efforts of others. According to the judge, in retail transactions, those others are the buyers on the other end of a transaction. They're anonymous. You don't know who they are.

That's an odd interpretation of the Howey test as we see it, and most judges' thinking that we've heard so far. The expectation of profit based on the efforts of others in this case would be based on Ripple Labs and its promotion of the Ripple ecosystem, in the same way that if you buy IBM shares, you're doing so in the expectation of profit based on what IBM does as a company and its operating performance. The fact that this is looking at that transaction very differently I think is something that needs to be considered.

JULIE HYMAN: Yeah. I want to zoom out for just a second here and, Kavita, give you the last word on this because we have this case, we had yesterday Alex Mashinsky of Celsius, the founder of Celsius, being arrested and charged by the SEC. Where are we in the sort of crypto cycle here? The fact that we're still arguing over these sort of definitional foundational regulations at the same time that we are still seeing fraud in the system, what's the big picture?

KAVITA GUPTA: It's a very good question, Julie, and I honestly believe that we are still at the very early stage. But being in crypto since 2013, I feel like at least the crypto has arrived the place where the mainstream media is really pushing to understand where does the regulation work. So you we do have projects like 3AC and FTX and, like, the bad actors like any other industry, and the more regulations and the more clarity on where do we stand is really going to help and protect the retail customers and also going to help and have the guideline of how founders and investors need to go into the place.

Said that, I think at the same time, I also do believe what Mark said, that we are going to see the digital asset regulations in the Supreme Court. But the positive side, again, which I want to underline, is that is decentralization a key, a way to distribute token is the key, the way of sales or the token itself or instrument itself has to go through those regulations. Having a clarity of it will push the overall blockchain industry, which is still, I believe, in the early stage when we compare it to the tech industry, very similar to how privacy laws or encryption laws accessible to everybody is.

My last-- my last thought would be here is clarity is great, otherwise US is already on the brink of losing some of the best tech from the blockchain community, and I don't think that's going to be helpful for anyone.

JULIE HYMAN: Mark, Kavita, thank you so much for your time here this morning. Berenberg Capital Markets senior equity research analyst Mark Palmer and Delta Blockchain fund general partner Kavita Gupta. Thank you.",Ripple

In a major win for the crypto industry, U.S. District Court Judge Analisa Torres ruled on Thursday that Ripple Labs’ programmatic sales of its XRP cryptocurrency did not qualify as financial securities.


The decision followed a 30-month legal battle, offering crypto investors a boost of optimism, which pushed up Bitcoin to US$31,736 on Friday and Ether to US$2,022, a high for Ether since May 2022.

“Thursday’s landmark ruling that Ripple’s XRP tokens sold on exchanges weren’t securities has in part contributed to the boost in the price of Bitcoin, pushing it past the long-awaited US$31,000,” Lucas Kiely, the chief investment officer of digital asset platform Yield App, told Forkast, adding that further positive news from institutions will boost Bitcoin prices.

In other positive news, Europe’s first Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) is expected to be publicly listed this month, following a 12-month delay. The news came after a flurry of spot Bitcoin ETF applications in the U.S. from financial heavyweights such as BlackRock, WisdomTree and Fidelity Investments.

Similar positive catalysts will be needed to boost investor sentiment and maintain Bitcoin above US$31,000, according to Jonas Betz, crypto market analyst and founder of consultancy firm Betz Crypto.

“The approval of a Bitcoin ETF would be a major step towards mainstream acceptance of Bitcoin, signaling regulatory confidence and potentially paving the way for significant institutional investment. News like this could trigger a bullish market reaction, pushing Bitcoin above US$31,000,” wrote Betz, in a statement shared with Forkast.

Boston-based Circle Internet Financial Limited, the issuer of the USDC stablecoin, on Wednesday announced workforce reductions and investment in non-core activities to refocus its business. The exact number of layoffs is unknown.

Adding to investor concerns, market talk suggested that the Bank of America was closing customer accounts related to Coinbase. The exchange’s chief executive officer, Brian Armstrong, created a Twitter poll on Wednesday asking if any customers had their Bank of America accounts closed due to transactions with Coinbase. Some 8.9% of the respondents said yes, while 19.3% said no and the other 71.9% simply chose “show results.”

The next day, Barclays downgraded Coinbase’s stock, ahead of the exchange’s earnings release scheduled for August 3, according to the bank’s research report. On the upside, the bank raised its price target for Coinbase stock to US$70, from US$61.

In the macroeconomy, U.S. inflation fell to 3% in June, down from 4% in May, representing the slowest rate of inflation since March 2021.

Max Breus, the co-founder and chief executive officer of Ubix Network, a protocol that connects blockchains with different consensus mechanisms, said that macroeconomic developments are just as important for the crypto market as the actions of regulatory agencies.

“The situation in the main global markets, the stock market, the bond market, the Fed’s rate policy is very important for investor sentiment. If there is a downtrend in global markets, then the cryptocurrency market will also be under pressure. Spot Bitcoin ETF is an important factor, but it is only a financial instrument. Global factors are more important for investor sentiment,” wrote Breus, in a statement shared with Forkast.

The global crypto market capitalization stood at US$1.25 trillion on Friday at 7:30 p.m. in Hong Kong, up 6.83% from US$1.17 trillion a week ago, according to CoinMarketCap data. With a market cap of US$606 billion, Bitcoin represented 48.5% of the market while Ether, valued at US$239 billion, accounted for 19.2%.

Notable Movers: XRP, XLM
The XRP token was this week’s biggest gainer among the top 100 coins, rising 72.16% to US$0.8036. XRP started its rally on Thursday, boosted by Ripple’s court win over the Securities and Exchange Commission.

The XLM token, the native crypto of the Stellar blockchain, was the week’s second-biggest gainer, up 57.57% to US$0.1515. The token started its rally on Thursday, in parallel with the XRP token, boosted by market-wide euphoria from the court ruling.

Next week: Bitcoin needs to close above US$31,000 to pave way to US$32,500
Next week, investors will attend the sixth edition of the Ethereum Community Conference (EthCC) in Paris, France, which is the largest Ethereum-themed convention in Europe.

On the macroeconomic front, the Federal Reserve is set to release its latest balance sheet on Thursday, showing the Fed’s assets and liabilities. Investors will also anticipate a Tuesday speech from the vice-chairman of the U.S. Federal Reserve, Michael Barr, for clues on the Fed’s upcoming monetary policy decisions.

Yield App’s Kiely said that Bitcoin needs to hold above US$30,500 to maintain its bullish momentum.

“July began with a steady upward trend. Bitcoin retook recent resistance levels of US$30,500 earlier this week. Staying above that level will be key if Bitcoin is to continue the bullish trend,” Kiely wrote.

Ubix Network’s Max Breus said that US$31,000 is a key level for Bitcoin investors to watch.

“This is the high level of consolidation since June 20. If the weekly price closes above US$31,000, then next week has a high chance of moving to US$32,500,” wrote Breus.

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/xrp-trading-volumes-hit-2-091617005.html,XRP Trading Volumes Hit $2.5B on South Korean Exchange UpBit,"Trading volumes of XRP tokens against the Korean won hit $2.5 billion on South Korean exchange UpBit in the past 24 hours, the highest among counterparts, in a sign of speculative frenzy.

This was more than 50% of the total trading volumes on UpBit in that period. Data shows market depth stood at nearly $5 million as of Asian morning hours, suggesting ample liquidity for the tokens as a $5 million buy or sell order would move the tokens only 2% on the exchange. Such liquidity is usually under $1 million, historical data shows.

The surge came as a U.S. court ruled the sale of XRP on exchanges did not constitute investment contracts. XRP rose as much as 96% following the court order before giving back gains on Friday morning.

Bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) usually account for the majority of the trading activity on UpBit, which makes the XRP volume surge an anomaly. Overall, ten South Korean exchanges turned billions of dollars worth of XRP - contributing to a significant part of the $13 billion in volumes across global exchanges.

Crypto exchange Binance, in comparison, traded a relatively lesser $2.2 million, CoinGecko data shows.

In crypto circles, South Korean traders are known for pushing euphoric rallies on tokens. The so-called Kimchi Premium originates from the region – where prices of bitcoin on local exchanges can trade at a premium of as much as 30% compared to international counterparts, driven by local demand.

However, some of that volume may be attributable to wash trading, a manipulative technique where traders continually buy and sell the same asset to drive up volumes in order to create a false impression of market activity.",Ripple 
https://finance.yahoo.com/news/xrp-ruling-landmark-judgment-weakens-065528118.html,"XRP Ruling a ‘Landmark’ Judgment, Weakens SEC's Stance Against Crypto: Bernstein","The U.S. district court ruling that Ripple’s XRP token should not be considered a security if sold via an exchange or through programmatic sales, is a landmark judgment for crypto, broker Bernstein said in a research report Thursday.

Bernstein notes that the court did rule that institutional sales of XRP violated securities law. Still, this was a major verdict, which removes the overhang on XRP and the holders of the token who bought it through exchanges, the report said.

The ruling reduces the “securities overhang on tokens sold on exchanges,” and is a “major relief for all tokens sold on secondary platforms,” analysts led by Gautam Chhugani wrote.

The court’s decision emphasizes the need for a separate digital assets framework, and given its interpretation it is clear that the “Howey test cannot be straight applied to tokens on exchange platforms, and thus the context of the transaction matters,” the note said.

“This weakens the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) stance that the securities law is clear and no separate clarity is required for digital assets, given the contextual interpretation required in every case,” the analysts wrote.

Bernstein says this is a landmark judgement and significantly shifts the “regulatory cloud over the crypto industry”, and it expects institutional investors who have steered clear of digital assets due to regulatory challenges to reconsider the asset class.

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/xrp-overtakes-bnb-become-4th-062257994.html,XRP Overtakes BNB to Become 4th Largest Cryptocurrency; Funding Rates Surge,"Payments-focused cryptocurrency XRP has surpassed BNB token to become the world's four-largest digital asset by market cap.

As of writing, XRP boasted a market cap of $41.44 billion, with the tally surging 66% in the past 24 hours alone, according to CoinDesk data. While BNB's market value rose 6.5% to $40.57 billion. XRP's price surged from 47 cents to nearly 78 cents.


Ripple Lab's partial victory in a long, drawn-out legal battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) over the sale of XRP has powered the cryptocurrency's surge.

On Thursday, the District Court for the Southern District of New York said Ripple's offer and sale of XRP on digital asset exchanges did not amount to offers and sales of investment contracts as alleged by the SEC.

The Court, however, said that Ripple's direct sale of XRP worth over $700 million to institutions, hedge funds and other parties violated securities laws. The SEC, in late 2020, filed a lawsuit against Ripple for selling unregistered securities after the company sold $1.3 billion worth of XRP. The regulatory action kept saw several exchanges delist XRP and kept the cryptocurrency under pressure while the broader market ended that year on a high note.

The first part of the ruling has opened doors for a renewed listing of XRP by centralized exchanges. Crypto.com has already taken the step and Gemini is exploring the listing of XRP for both spot and derivatives trading.

Meanwhile, the second part of the ruling has determined that XRP is a security, according to CoinShares’ Head of Product, Townsend Lansing.

""The Court has found Ripple to be in violation of securities laws, specifically in relation to direct sales to institutional investors. As such, XRP is not only deemed a security, but questions have arisen regarding the legality of its offering. In regards to these sales, the Court has confirmed that the law was indeed violated, marking a considerable victory for the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and setting a precedent for its legal actions against other cryptocurrencies,"" Langsing said in an email.

""It is important to note that institutional investors who purchased directly from Ripple may find themselves subject to class-action litigation as potential underwriters. This is an area to watch closely, especially if big-name venture capitalists were involved,"" Langsing added.

Traders have yet to focus on the second part of the ruling, as evident from the price surge and the bullish positioning in the perpetual futures market.

Data from Coinglass show aggregated volume-weighted perpetual futures funding rates worldwide have jumped to the highest since at least December. The open interest-weighted rates have risen to a four-month high.

Both suggest the leverage is decisively skewed to the bullish side.

Funding rates are periodic payments of an asset between bullish long and bearish short position holders in the perpetual futures market. A positive funding rate means longs are dominant and are paying shorts to keep their positions open.",Ripple

The second largest cryptocurrency by market cap was up 7.4% at $2,010 during the Asian morning hours. Various layer-1 tokens, such as Solana’s SOL, which has been accused by the SEC of being a security, also recorded double digit gains following the Ripple-SEC ruling on Thursday.

At the time of writing, SOL jumped 33.8%, MATIC gained 19.5%, Cardano's ADA was up 25%, and Stellar’s XLM soared 52%, in the last 24 hours.

The governance token of Lido DAO (LDO) was also up 25% in the last 24 hours. The CoinDesk Market Index (CMI), a measure of crypto markets performance, was up 7.2%.

Bitcoin (BTC) also passed its one-year high, trading at $31,424. Ripple's XRP nearly doubled after the ruling and was trading 66% at 78 cents at the time of writing.

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bitcoin-ether-surge-ripple-notched-020450410.html,"Bitcoin, Ether surge after Ripple notched partial win against SEC; Ripple’s XRP leads crypto rally","Bitcoin surged on Friday morning in Asia to breach the US$31,000 resistance level, after Ripple Labs achieved a partial victory in its three-year lawsuit against the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The regulator  accused Ripple of offering XRP as an unregistered security. Along with Bitcoin, Ether and all other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies logged considerable gains, with XRP spearheading the rally with a rise of over 70%. U.S. equity futures traded flat in the Asia time zone on Friday as investors await earnings reports from major U.S. banks. Thursday’s U.S. producer price index (PPI) has added to a sense that inflation is slowing in the country.

XRP ruling provides crypto market boost
Bitcoin climbed 3.45% over the last 24 hours to US$31,463 as of 07:50 a.m. in Hong Kong for a weekly gain of 4.93%, according to data from CoinMarketCap. The world’s largest cryptocurrency reached a high of US$31,814 early Friday morning, the highest price since June 2022.


In a summary judgement on Thursday,  New York Southern District Court Judge Analisa Torres ruled that Ripple’s programmatic sales of the XRP token on public exchanges do not constitute securities, marking a partial victory for Ripple with the SEC. The regulator first sued the San Francisco-based financial technology firm on the grounds that XRP constitutes a security in 2020.

The verdict came with a critical caveat, however.  The court ruled that Ripple’s XRP sales to institutional investors did violate securities laws.

Nonetheless, Ripple’s Chief Executive Officer Stuart Alderoty called the judgement “a huge win” in a Friday tweet.


Alderoty said that “the only thing the Court found constitutes an investment contract is past direct XRP sales to institutional clients.” Those transactions will now be subject to further court proceedings.

Despite the overall optimism in the crypto community evidenced by the upswing in the market, there are also a number of industry voices sounding a note of caution.

In an emailed comment, CoinShares’ Head of Product Townsend Lansing said that the aspect of the ruling that identifies Ripple’s sales to institutional customers as a violation of securities law marks “a considerable victory for the SEC.”

The ruling will now set a precedent for legal action against other cryptocurrencies by regulators, he said.

“It is important to note that institutional investors who purchased directly from Ripple may find themselves subject to class-action litigation as potential underwriters,” Lansing added. “This is an area to watch closely, especially if big-name venture capitalists were involved.”

But, while some sense of jeopardy remained for those involved, Justin d’Anethan, head of APAC business development at Belgium-based crypto market maker Keyrock, believes that the ruling had at least “shook investors in the best of ways.”

Elsewhere, Europe’s first Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) is set for a public listing this month. That follows a 12-month delay from the initially planned date, the Financial Times reported on Thursday.

Experts have identified the listing as another potential catalyst for the crypto market.

“With the talks of ETFs in the background, the idea that we could see products tracking many cryptocurrencies is not implausible and traders are naturally positioning themselves accordingly,” said Keyrock’s d’Anethan.

Like Bitcoin, Ether surged 6.99% to US$2,004, moving up 7.69% for the week. The token is trading above US$2,000 for the first time since April.

Boosted by the ruling on the SEC-Ripple case, all other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies rose in the past 24 hours. Cardano’s ADA, Solana’s SOL and Polygon’s MATIC each logged two-digit gains.

XRP, subject of the SEC’s lawsuit against issuer Ripple, jumped 72.75% to US$0.8142 and added 74.89% for the week. In doing so, it replaced Binance’s BNB as the third largest non-stablecoin cryptocurrency by market cap.

The total crypto market capitalization rose 6.19% in the past 24 hours to US$1.26 trillion, while trading volume jumped 95.72% to US$60.3 billion.

Forkast 500 up, Dapper Labs announces layoffs
The indexes are proxy measures of the performance of the global NFT market. They are managed by CryptoSlam, a sister company of Forkast.News under the Forkast.Labs umbrella.

The main Forkast 500 NFT index edged up 0.14% in the past 24 hours to 2,699.39 as of 09:55 a.m. in Hong Kong. Forkast’s Solana and Cardano NFT market indices also moved higher, while the Etheum and Polygon indices dropped.

Despite the overnight rise in cryptocurrency prices associated with the Ripple ruling, total NFT sales volume dipped 1.72% in the past 24 hours to US$24.45 million, according to data from CryptoSlam.

Among all NFT collections, Bitcoin-based $FRAM BRC-20 NFTs topped the 24-hour sales volume, edging up 0.31% to US$2.14 million. In doing so, it recorded over two thirds of the total volume on the Bitcoin network. Ethereum-based collections Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) and the Captainz ranked second and third respectively.

BAYC #1734, part of the BAYC collection, topped collectible sales in the past 24 hours. It was sold at 600 Ether (US$1.2 million) early Friday. As exciting as this big sale is, BAYC #1734 was previously sold at 800 Ether in January 2022.

“This grail Bored Ape was sold at a huge loss, but the takeaway is that there is still a market for very high-priced NFTs, even in a bear market,” said Yehudah Petscher, NFT Strategist at Forkast Labs, the parent company of Forkast.News.

As the bear market continues, Dapper Labs, the developer of hit NFT collections such as CryptoKitties and NBA Top Shot,  announced the layoff of 51 staff on Thursday — roughly 12% of its workforce.

“The decision was incredibly difficult” but necessary to “ensure a lean and efficient” company, said Dapper Labs Chief Executive Officer Roham Gharegozlou in a letter to employees. It is the third round of layoffs at the company in the past 12 months. Those layoffs saw its workforce cut by 22% in November 2022 and by a further 20% in February this year.

Cool Cats Group, the Web3 company behind NFT collection Cool Cats, announced a partnership with game developer nWayPlay,  a subsidiary of Hong Kong-based software and investment giant Animoca Brands. Together, the two companies will develop a Web3 game set to be released between late 2023 and early 2024.

US equities flat amid data releases

U.S. stock futures traded flat as of 11:50 a.m. in Hong Kong.  All three major U.S. indexes closed higher in regular Thursday trading, with the Nasdaq leading the gains with a 1.58% rise.

The U.S. producer price index (PPI) released Thursday recorded a 0.1% year-on-year rise for the month of June, down from 0.9% in May. The June figure is the smallest increase since August 2020.

The data is also well below analyst expectations of a 0.4% annual increase in PPI. Combined with weak consumer price index data released on Wednesday, the data points to a slowdown in U.S. inflation.

“The better-than-expected inflation figures for June 2023 would suggest that policy is working to ease price pressures as higher interest rates reduce demand. Key payroll figures announced in early July also came in below expectations with the economy generating less jobs than expected in June,” said Keith Wade, chief economist & strategist at asset management Schroders.

However, given lingering inflation worries, Wade still expects the Federal Reserve to make another interest rate hike in July. The tight labor market and the potential for a reversal in the Fed’s monetary policy could, Wade said, trigger a rally in the bond market that would “loosen financial conditions.”

“Given the efforts the Fed has made to convince markets they were serious about inflation and not about to pivot, this would seem to be too early,” said Wade.

Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller said in a Thursday speech that the Fed would need to “keep policy restrictive for some time” in order to reduce inflation below its 2% target. He said that he anticipates two more rate hikes by the end of the year.

“I am more confident that the banking turmoil is not going to result in a significant problem for the economy, and I see no reason why the first of those two hikes should not occur at our meeting later this month,” said Waller.

Meanwhile, a Wednesday report by financial comparison service company Bankrate showed that economists believe there is a 59% chance the U.S. economy will enter a recession inside the next twelve months. The report cited concern about the long-term economic impact of this year’s extended series of rate hikes.

The 59% figure is, however, a decrease on the 64% chance given in April, and the lowest level in the past 12 months.

The Federal Reserve meets on July 26 to discuss its next move on rates, which now sit between 5% and 5.25%. The CME FedWatch Tool predicts a 92.4% chance the Fed will enact a 25-basis-point rate increase this month, and a 7.6% chance it will leave the rate unchanged.

Investors are now awaiting the release of second-quarter earnings reports from major financial institutions on Friday. The releases will include reports from JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo, Citigroup, BlackRock and more.

Elsewhere, main stock indexes across Asia traded higher on Friday morning. China’s Shanghai Composite, Hong Kong’s Hang Seng, Japan’s Nikkei and South Korea’s Kospi all posted rises as of 12:30 p.m. in Hong Kong.",Ripple
